**School-wide Values-in-Action (VIA) activity on 24 March (Saturday)**  
 
The whole school will be embarking on a service activity on 24 March to collect newspaper and old clothing from the neighbouring blocks at Choa Chu Kang and Teck Whye estates.  Through this activity, we hope to develop in our students the following qualities:
