### 1\. The Prefectorial Board

The School's Prefectorial Board comprises a body of student leaders elected by their teachers and peers for their exemplary conduct.  Not only are these students role models, they are also servant leaders.  They help the school in various programmes and activities like parents-teachers-meeting, Speech Day, orientations etc.  They also play a disciplinary role and help to remind fellow students of their conduct and behaviour.  Outside of the school, they are emissaries of the school and the Prefect Tie they wear is symbolic of that status endowed upon them.
