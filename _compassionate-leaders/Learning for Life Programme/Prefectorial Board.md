### 1\. The Prefectorial Board

The School's Prefectorial Board comprises a body of student leaders elected by their teachers and peers for their exemplary conduct.  Not only are these students role models, they are also servant leaders.  They help the school in various programmes and activities like parents-teachers-meeting, Speech Day, orientations etc.  They also play a disciplinary role and help to remind fellow students of their conduct and behaviour.  Outside of the school, they are emissaries of the school and the Prefect Tie they wear is symbolic of that status endowed upon them.

**Identification, Observation and Appointment Process of Student Leaders**   

Students selected for the higher rungs of leadership positions (e.g. Prefects, CCA Leaders, Class Committee) are put through an observation period before they are officially appointed. During the observation period, such students are given specific tasks or projects where the various leadership behaviours can be observed and assessed by their seniors and the teachers.
