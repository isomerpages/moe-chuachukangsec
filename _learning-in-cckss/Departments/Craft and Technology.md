<p>The Craft &amp; Technology Department offers applied learning subjects
like Art, Design and Technology (D&amp;T), Food and Consumer Education
(FCE) / Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) and Music. Through problem-based
learning set-in real-life contexts and hands-on approaches, the curriculum
aims to provide our students with knowledge and skills, and inculcate in
them positive attitudes that will empower them to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>openly explore and express their ideas and feelings through visual and
tactile forms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>harness their curiosity and ability to create in response to needs identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be health-conscious and discerning consumers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop abilities for creative musical expression and communication</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong><u>Art</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The aims of art education in our schools are to enable every child to
enjoy art, communicate visually, and make meaning through connecting with
society and culture. The three learning domains – perceive, communicate,
appreciate – encapsulate the cognitive, affective and psychomotor dimensions
of students’ engagement in art. At the Lower Secondary level, students
are provided with opportunities to develop themselves as active artists
and informed audiences with curious minds that are open to exploring and
experimenting in art, with critical and inventive thinking in creative
expression, with personal voice and capacity to collaborate with others
in art; and awareness, interest, and respect for art from diverse social
and cultural perspectives.</p>
<p>For Upper Secondary Art, students respond to and interpret visual images
and objects sensitively and informatively. They learn to express their
thoughts, experiences and feelings in visual, tactile, oral or literary
forms. Through research and exploration, students develop process skills
to reinforce the effectiveness of communicating. Students learn to evaluate
and appreciate artworks made by themselves and other artists and are able
to see the connection of the visual arts to their lives and better appreciate
its significance in the wider context of culture and society.</p>
<p>To make art learning more enriching and meaningful, experiences beyond
the classroom such as visits to artists’ studios and heritage sites are
organized, Such activities connect students to how artworks are produced,
experienced and valued in real life.</p>

<p><strong><u>Design &amp; Technology</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In D&amp;T, students learn mainly through design-and-make projects guided
by a design process. The design process entails identifying design needs
from real-world experiences, generating and developing ideas, and realising
the design solution; with research carried out when necessary. Research
includes testing ideas through quick mock-ups and evaluating the final
design solution with the intended user. In doing so, students acquire related
knowledge and develop skills that turn ideas into reality and values like
mindfulness, empathy and sensitivity in the areas of social, culture and
environment.</p>
<p>Students who wish to pursue D&amp;T at the Upper Secondary level would
immerse themselves in more in-depth studies of design and prototyping ideas
through applying technology. Through the design process, students cultivate
creative, critical and reflective thinking to make sense of their learning
and to develop related dispositions and skills using graphical means and
technology.</p>
<p>Learning journeys to design-related industries allow our students to widen
their exposure and interest in product ideation.</p>

<p><strong><u>Food &amp; Consumer Education (Lower Secondary) and Nutrition &amp; Food Science (Upper Secondary)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The FCE syllabus is designed to empower students to be health-conscious
and discerning consumers, enabling them to better manage their lives for
the present and the future. Students who offer FCE as a subject (including
Food &amp; Consumer Education and Nutrition &amp; Food Science) develop
attitudes and skills that will help them stay relevant in the ever-changing
world they live in.</p>
<p>Students who wish to further their interest in NFS at the upper secondary
level they will have the opportunities to apply scientific principles during
food preparation and cooking. They also learn to appreciate the importance
of using a variety of food commodities in food management and the issues
of food security, including food safety and sustainable food consumption.
In this way, they will also be able to advocate nutrition and health for
self, family and the community, thereby achieving the student outcomes
of a health ambassador, a discerning consumer and a food innovator.</p>
<p>Hands-on activities through practical cooking allow students to acquire
different food preparation techniques and cooking methods in preparing
dishes/meals for different situations.&nbsp; Investigative food science
experiments such as the effect of sugar on baked products help students
to develop critical and logical thinking as they analyse, interpret and
establish the validity of the experimental data.</p>
<p>Learning journeys to culinary-related organizations such as SHATEC are
organized to enhance students’ learning and widen their exposure in the
subject.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Music</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Lower Secondary Music curriculum seeks to develop musical understanding
through the three Musical Processes of Listening, Creating and Performing.
Students actively listen to experience and explore how music from a range
of cultures and genres can convey ideas, experiences and emotions. Through
improvising, composing and other ways of creating, students learn to communicate
their ideas in and through music, build their expressive skills and develop
their unique personal voice. Students will also develop skills to use a
variety of sound materials, techniques and tools, as well as apply their
understanding of musical concepts. There are opportunities for students
to perform individually as well as in collaboration with others in class
or as part of a community.</p>
<p>The school is on board the Performing-Arts Based Learning (PABL), a core
learning experience in the revised Music Syllabus, whereby Secondary 1
students are given the opportunity to experience a bespoke live music performance
in a professional arts and cultural venue.</p>
