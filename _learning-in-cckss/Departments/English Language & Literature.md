<h4><strong>About the Department</strong></h4>
<p>As teachers in the English &amp; Literature Department, we are truly committed
to helping our students grow, not just as better users of the language,
but as curious, thoughtful individuals. We believe in the power of stories
and the impact that language has on shaping our world. Every lesson we
teach is driven by a genuine desire to inspire a love for reading, writing,
and learning. It's not just about improving grammar or vocabulary—it's
about encouraging our students to think deeply, express themselves clearly,
and develop a lasting appreciation for the beauty and complexity of language.
We're here to guide, support, and empower them every step of the way.</p>

<h4><strong>Teaching and Learning Approaches</strong></h4>
<p>“<em>Language shapes the way we think, and determines what we can think about.</em>” <strong>– Benjamin Lee Whorf</strong>
</p>
<p>At Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, the English Language and Literature
Department is dedicated to helping our students grow into <em>Empathetic Communicators</em>, <em>Discerning Readers</em>,
and <em>Creative Inquirers</em>. We believe in nurturing these qualities
because they are at the heart of the EL Syllabus 2020. Our goal is to inspire
our students to connect meaningfully with others, think critically, and
explore the world with curiosity and creativity.</p>
<p>The EL Syllabus 2020 emphasises key Areas of Language Learning (AoLL)
aimed at developing adolescent literacy. These areas include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Listening and Viewing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading and Viewing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking and Representing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing and Representing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grammar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vocabulary</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To nurture these skills in our students, teachers follow the six guiding
Principles of EL Teaching and Learning (CLLIPS). They also consider the
Teaching Processes (ACoLADE) to ensure effective and holistic language
development.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Learning / Department Activities</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Library and Reading Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Library and Reading Programme is designed to foster a passion for
reading among CCKSians, introducing them to a diverse range of texts and
genres. Through engaging activities like 'Blind Date with a Book' and Mobile
Carts, we make reading both enjoyable and accessible, encouraging students
to explore new literary experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Speak Good English Movement (SGEM)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Speak Good English Movement (SGEM) is a bi-weekly presentation held
during Thursday morning assemblies. Its goal is to inspire students to
speak standard English, helping them become effective communicators and
gain confidence in public speaking.</p>

<p><strong>Writer’s Toolbox</strong>
</p>
<p>In 2025, the department will be introducing the Writer’s Toolbox to all
students at Chua Chu Kang Secondary School. This innovative writing programme,
powered by patented AI, is designed to support CCKSians in mastering the
art of writing. It will work alongside the EL Syllabus 2020 curriculum
to enhance their writing skills and learning experience.</p>

<p><strong>The Literature Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The CCKSS Literature programme endeavours to enable our students to discover
the world of prose, poetry and plays. In doing so the programme hopes for
students to become empathetic, critical thinkers who are creative and expressive.
Students can engage with varied texts that not only broaden their understanding
of the world around them but also challenge them to negotiate meaning and
take on multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>In CCKSS we also strive for students to make personal connections with
the texts they read and relate them to world we live in. All students are
exposed to the awe-inspiring and magical world of plays with our Theatre
Experience programme and are also encouraged to take part in our Poetry
Slam competition. With such involvement we hope to nurture a generation
of avid readers who are able to appreciate the nuanced kaleidoscope of
life.</p>
