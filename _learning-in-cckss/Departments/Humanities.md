<h4><strong>About the Department</strong></h4>
<p>The Humanities Department comprises of the History, Geography, Social
Studies, Principles of Accounts and Elements of Business Skills units.
The Humanities Department aims to develop, among CCKSians, inquiry-oriented
learning dispositions that will allow them to make sense of the complexities
of societal issues that they will encounter.</p>
<h4><strong>Teaching &amp; Learning Approaches</strong></h4>
<p>Our key teaching and learning approach is adopted in line with the aim
to help students become inquiry-oriented learners. As such the department
adopts an inquiry-based approach towards teaching and learning to enable
students to reach for deeper and enduring understanding of concepts through
their own discovery and reasoning.</p>

<h4><strong>Social Studies</strong></h4>
<p>At the heart of the Singapore Social Studies curriculum is the preparation
of students to be effective citizens by helping them to better understand
the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in, and appreciate
the complexities of the human experience.</p>
<p>Drawing on aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to students,
Social Studies seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world
issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning
experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge
and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking
skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Social Studies seeks to inculcate in students a deeper understanding of
the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that
will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world in which
they live, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.
The curriculum therefore envisions students as informed, concerned and
participative citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned
spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in.</p>

<h4><strong>Geography</strong></h4>
<p>Geography bridges the humanities, social and natural sciences. It is a
holistic subject that provides students with integrative ways of understanding
the real world. Students will explore Earth, its natural and man-made environments,
and examine the interactions of humans with these environments, from the
personal to global scales. Geography fascinates and inspires students,
enabling them to gain a deep appreciation of Earth’s beauty, the immense
power of natural forces, and the ingenious ways humans thrive under different
circumstances. Through Geography, students will understand how places and
landscapes evolve, deliberate on consequences arising from our everyday
decisions, and experience the mosaic of cultures and societies.</p>
<p>Fieldwork satisfies and nourishes students’ curiosity about contemporary
issues that affect their communities. Through fieldwork, students apply
their classroom learning in the real world to make new discoveries. They
also get to hone their abilities to generate innovative solutions and help
make our world a better place. Such learning experiences make Geography
a vital resource, in enabling students living in an interconnected world
to discover what it means to live sustainably and exist harmoniously with
one another and with other living species.</p>

<h4><strong>History</strong></h4>
<p>History education in Singapore seeks to develop in students an appreciation
of past human experiences, critical awareness of the nature of historical
knowledge, and the ability to make connections between the past and present.</p>
<p>History prepares students to thrive as citizens in a complex and fast-changing
world by equipping them with the knowledge and skills to understand how
forces, events and developments of the past shaped today’s world. It also
develops in students a disciplined and critical mind to discern and make
informed judgements based on consideration of multiple perspectives, reasoned
and well-substantiated conclusions.</p>
<p>History also helps students to participate actively in a globalised world,
as they learn to make sense of ambiguous and complex global developments,
appreciate local contexts and engage with different cultures and societies
sensitively. These are encapsulated in the seven qualities of a history
learner which the History curriculum aims to develop:</p>

<h4><strong>Principles of Accounts</strong></h4>
<p>Principles of Accounts is designed to teach age-appropriate and relevant
accounting knowledge, skills and values. In addition, students will understand
how businesses use accounting and nonaccounting information to make decisions.
Through the subject, they will acquire transferrable skills that they can
apply in their daily lives. This subject forms part of a broad-based education
to equip students with strong fundamentals for future learning.</p>
<p>Principles of Accounts aims to help students to become users of accounting
information and make informed decisions using both accounting and non-accounting
business-related information. By learning to become users of information,
students understand:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>what business decisions are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how decisions are made using accounting information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the limitations of relying only on accounting information; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the consideration of non-accounting business-related information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Elements of Business Skills</strong></h4>
<p>Elements of Business Skills is an introduction to business through an
understanding of business activities, focusing on basic marketing and customer
relations, in the context of Singapore. The syllabus intends to provide
students with opportunities to develop transferable employability skills
and knowledge in the service industry, namely the Travel and Tourism, Hospitality,
and Retail industries, which continue to offer employment opportunities
accessible to the students. It provides students with the foundational
knowledge and skills for further studies in institutes of higher learning
and the awareness of prospects of a career in the service industry.</p>
