<p>The Mother Tongue Fortnight Carnival is the highlight of the series of
programmes. This carnival was staged with the intention of catering a genuine
carnival experience, infused with local heritage and flavours, to our students.
A huge variety of traditional snacks and crafts were sourced and put together
in a day long carnival that students were allowed to visit during their
respective Mother Tongue lessons.</p>
<p>In collaboration with members from our Parent Support Group, food and
tea booths, games and craftwork stations were set up timely for the carnival.
Students were treated to traditional flavours like <em>kueh</em>, <em>kacang puteh, putu piring, putu mayam</em> and
more. Concurrently, students can also indulge in rounds of traditional
games like <em>capteh, kuti kuti </em>or even a match over chess. Alternatively,
craftwork booths were also readily available for students to create meaningful
souvenirs for themselves or even their parents. <em>Bunga rampai</em> sachets,
mosaic coasters, <em>pongal</em> pot paintings, herbal massagers and many
more were some of the Asian heritage craftworks that students were guided
to complete.</p>

<h4><strong>Celebration of Festivals</strong></h4>
<p>MTL Department organises traditional festivals from different cultures.
This provides students with an immersive experience in the joyful festive
atmosphere. These celebrations not only allow students to immerse themselves
in the festivities but also provide an opportunity for them to understand
and appreciate the meanings and values behind each festival. By gaining
a deeper understanding of the cultural significance of these celebrations,
students develop a stronger attachment to their own culture and traditions,
fostering a sense of pride and appreciation for their heritage.</p>
<p><strong>Chinese New Year Celebrations</strong>
</p>
<p>“Lohei” or “捞鱼生” which means “toss up a good fortune”. During Chinese
new year, our students come together to participate in the lively activity
of lohei. This involves tossing and mixing various ingredients together
while expressing well wishes and blessings for the upcoming year. By actively
participating in Lohei, students embrace the festive spirit and celebrate
the Lunar New Year with enthusiasm and positivity.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pongal </em>Celebration</strong>

vibrant traditions of <em>Deepavali</em>. With booths featuring <em>henna</em> painting,
art and craft and the trying on of traditional costumes, our CCKSians had
plenty of fun as they learnt more about <em>Deepavali</em> with their friends

<h4><strong>Mother Tongue Language Learning Journeys</strong></h4>
<p>Learning journeys to heritage sites, such as Little India, Kampong Glam,
and Singapore Chinese Cultural Center, provide our students with immersive
experiences allowing them to have the opportunity to witness firsthand
the vibrant traditions, customs, and historical significance embedded within
their respective cultures. These learning journeys foster a stronger connection
and appreciation for their heritage, enabling students to embrace their
cultural identity with pride.</p>
<h4><strong>Reading Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Extensive reading is extremely important for the development of language
proficiency. It is also the foundation for developing discerning readers
able to engage texts critically. Students will be exposed to a wide array
of different text types, with structured exercises to develop their reading
skills.&nbsp;Students participate in book discussions, storytelling sessions,
and interactive reading challenges that make reading both enjoyable and
meaningful. The highlight of the programme is a grand showcase, where students
present their learning through creative performances such as book dialogues
and skits. This culminating event not only celebrates their reading journey
but also fosters confidence and appreciation for literature.</p>

</div>
<p>In addition to the enriching activities of our reading programme, our
Chinese Language Unit also publishes a student anthology, <em>Huifeng Xulai</em>.
This collection features students’ creative writings and their perspectives
on various social phenomena, showcasing their depth of thought and expressive
abilities in the Chinese language. Through this anthology, students not
only share their ideas and creativity but also inspire their peers to engage
with societal issues and develop independent thinking skills.</p>

<h4><strong>Cultural Performance Exposure</strong></h4>
<p>The Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme (CPES) (“文化随意门”计划) is an initiative
by The Commitee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL) since 2009.
The objective is to enhance students' interest in Chinese Language and
Culture through attendance at Chinese cultural performances at public performing
arts venues.</p>

<h4><strong>Singapore Book of Records</strong></h4>
<p>In the beginning of 2024, as we embarked on our merged school journey
stronger together, our student artists conceptualized and created a dragon
painting to usher in the new year. In the relentless pursuit of excellence,
aligned with the school value of enterprise, they went many steps ahead
to create a 3-dimensional dragon sculpture. Throughout the process, they
met with countless setbacks but pressed on with resilience to bring their
project to fruition. This collaboration between the Mother Tongue and Aesthetics
Departments was entered into the Singapore Book of Records!</p>
