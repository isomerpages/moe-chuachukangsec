<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight Carnival</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Fortnight Carnival is the highlight of the series of
programmes. This carnival was staged with the intention of catering a genuine
carnival experience, infused with local heritage and flavours, to our students.
A huge variety of traditional snacks and crafts were sourced and put together
in a day long carnival that students were allowed to visit during their
respective Mother Tongue lessons.</p>
<p>In collaboration with members from our Parent Support Group, food and
tea booths, games and craftwork stations were set up timely for the carnival.
Students were treated to traditional flavours like <em>kueh</em>, <em>kacang puteh, putu piring, putu mayam</em> and
more. Concurrently, students can also indulge in rounds of traditional
games like <em>capteh, kuti kuti </em>or even a match over chess. Alternatively,
craftwork booths were also readily available for students to create meaningful
souvenirs for themselves or even their parents. <em>Bunga rampai</em> sachets,
mosaic coasters, <em>pongal</em> pot paintings, herbal massagers and many
more were some of the Asian heritage craftworks that students were guided
to complete.</p>
