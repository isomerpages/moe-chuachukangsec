<h2><strong>Personalised Digital Learning Programme</strong></h2>
<p>MOE introduced Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all
secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student had a
school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. The intended
outcomes of PDLP are as follows:</p>
<h4><strong>Support the development of digital literacies</strong></h4>
<p>Students will learn digital skills such as gathering and evaluating information
online, interacting with the online community, and creating digital products.</p>
<h4><strong>Support self-directed and collaborative learning</strong></h4>
<p>Students can access digital resources on their own to acquire knowledge
about a topic of their interest beyond the curriculum. They can also share
and build on one another’s ideas, and refine their own understanding.</p>
<h4><strong>Enhance Teaching &amp; Learning</strong></h4>
<p>The learning environment in PDLP allows teachers and students to harness
technology for greater effectiveness in teaching. For example, instructions,
activities and feedback for each student could be more tailored and relevant
to students’ learning needs.</p>
<p>In 2025, the model of PLD for our secondary one students will be using
Chromebook, more information would be provided during the Secondary 1 Welcome
night.</p>
