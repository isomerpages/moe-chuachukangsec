### Personalised Digital Learning Programme

MOE introduced Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student had a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. The intended outcomes of PDLP are as follows:

#### Support the development of digital literacies 
Students will learn digital skills such as gathering and evaluating information online, interacting with the online community, and creating digital products.   

#### Support self-directed and collaborative learning 
Students can access digital resources on their own to acquire knowledge about a topic of their interest beyond the curriculum. They can also share and build on one another’s ideas, and refine their own understanding.
  
#### Enhance Teaching & Learning 
The learning environment in PDLP allows teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching. For example, instructions, activities and feedback for each student could be more tailored and relevant to students’ learning needs.  

In 2023, the model of PLD for our secondary one students will be using Chromebook, more information would be provided during the Secondary 1 Welcome night.
