TWSS’ emphasis on Sustainability and CCKSS’ focus on Robotics and Automation promise exciting synergy and opportunities! Science comes alive at the newly merged Chua Chu Kang Secondary School (德惠中学)! 

Programming is the emerging lingua franca in this new digital world. At the same time, climate change is real, and sustainable development is the way forward for humanity. The Technology in Sustainability programme aims to ignite in you a passion for science and technology, equip you with programming skills, and nurture you to be thinkers and movers of sustainable solutions for a greener world.

Through thoughtfully integrated project work, ideate, adapt, propose and prototype creative solutions to real-world problems. Using concepts learnt in science, experiment with growing your own vegetables at our rooftop urban farm and apply your programming skills to design sensors to control environmental conditions in urban farming. Thereafter, cook your own produce, à la Master Chef, during Food &amp; Consumer Education lessons in the ‘Farm to Table’ project, or donate your harvest to the neighbourhood community fridge to help the less fortunate. As food security becomes critical for Singapore, we poise you to be at the forefront of innovations in agri-food production.
