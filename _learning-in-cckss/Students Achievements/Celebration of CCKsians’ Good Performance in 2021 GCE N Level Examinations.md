Kyston Teo exemplified many of the values we wish every CCKsian to personify. He was an all-rounder and excelled both within and outside the classroom. As a learner, he was self-directed, receptive to feedback, and engaged in reflection and introspection to improve his studies. As a student leader, he was humble and showed in his actions what it meant to serve.

Never shying away from expressing his opinions, Kyston always performed well during presentations and public speaking opportunities. He was able to explore issues from different perspectives during class discussions and value-add to the discussions. He took the time and trouble to deliberate over issues and weighed his words carefully before he spoke. His exemplary attitude towards his studies earned for him an Edusave Scholarship.

Kyston cared for the less fortunate and did his part for the school and wider community, from raising awareness on the importance of sustainable practices to protect our environment to participating in recycling efforts to benefit the community. From 2018 to 2020, he also participated in the Green School @ Southwest initiative, a programme that aimed to promote environment friendly practices. 

Kyston did not allow the pandemic to extinguish his desire to serve others. He showed active support for advocacy activities and continued with this even during the pandemic. As part of a class effort to help the Animal Lovers League animal shelter with their adoption drive, he helped to design brochures and posters for their outreach efforts, and together with other members of his group, saw the project to fruition.

Kyston was a leader, serving as Class Chairman. His form teacher for four years, Mr Neal Cooke, said, “I could always count on Kyston to work with the class on school and class projects. He was a good team leader and motivated the class to always show respect to teachers and each other. His determination to be an all-rounder rubbed off on his classmates too.” 

Kyston carried himself with proper decorum and sought to role model the school values. In recognition of his exemplary character, his humility and his desire to serve and contribute, he received the Edusave Character Award and the school's Students That Achieve - Recognition (S.T.A.R.) Award.

Said Kyston on his achievements, “Despite going through tough times early in my secondary school life when I had little motivation to study, I persevered. The school provided me with multiple avenues to develop as an all-rounded individual through community projects and CCA. I wish all CCKSians will treasure these opportunities.”

We are immensely proud of Kyston, and we wish him well in his future endeavors.

### EXCEL – Story of Personal Excellence 

**NICHOLE HO YUXUAN** (Class 4-2)

If excellence is not an act, but a habit, then Nichole has this habit down pat. She was a recipient of both the Edusave Scholarship Award and Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership and Services (EAGLES) in 2021, attesting to her excellence in academic and co-curricular areas.

She was strong in English Language and Humanities and did consistently well for these subjects. As a student, she wrote fluently in English and was also an eloquent speaker. She would express her views and ideas confidently during class presentations and discussions. When in doubt, she would seek clarification and was receptive to feedback from teachers. Nichole’s form teacher, Ms Zhang, observed, “Nichole was a conscientious student and conducted herself with maturity in whatever she did in school.” It was little wonder she was able to manage her time efficiently and keep her focus on attaining her goals.

Nichole was a dedicated member of the Modern Dance Club. Striving for excellence, she would practise diligently to perfect her techniques. Her dedication led to her appointment as Dance Captain of the Modern Dance Club in 2021. As a member of the Executive Committee, she led the club in technique routines. She was able to give clear instructions during training sessions and saw it as her responsibility to coach and motivate her juniors in improving their techniques.

Nichole represented the school in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation in 2019 and 2021. The Modern Dance Club attained the Certificate of Distinction in 2019 and the Certificate of Accomplishment in 2021. 

Nichole has a heart for the less fortunate and showed active support for community service activities. She worked with her classmates on various level-wide Values-in-Action (VIA) projects. She also made use of her passion and talent in dance to put up a performance for PCF Childcare Centre in 2019.

Nichole's positive attitude and drive to excel will continue to inspire those around her.

### EXCEL – Story of Personal Excellence 

**DANISH IRFAN BIN AZMAN** (Class 4-1)

A quiet thinker and a self-directed learner, Danish understood his priorities and had a clear sense of direction, which motivated and spurred him towards excelling in every aspect of his student life in CCKSS. 

Mr Rick Chan, Danish’s Form Teacher for three years, remarked, “Danish is an independent learner who puts much effort to excel in his studies.” When in class, you would often see him paying keen attention to lessons and meticulously scribbling down notes to facilitate his understanding of the content taught. He was consistent in his work and always handed in work of a high standard, much to his teachers’ delight.

Although he was one of the quieter students in class, Danish was not afraid to voice his opinions. He willingly contributed ideas while listening with an open mind. He was receptive to feedback, using the feedback given to reflect on his shortcomings and seek to become a better version of himself.

Danish also sought to excel as a leader in the class. He took advantage of leadership workshops organised by the school, such as the 360 Degree Leadership workshop and the Student Leaders' Forum, to hone his leadership competencies. His teachers could depend on him to lead the class and selected him to be a member of the class committee throughout his four years in CCKSS. 

This attitude of striving for excellence could be seen in his CCA as well. As a dedicated member of the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), Danish trained diligently to ensure his unit distinguished itself in the NPCC Unit Overall Proficiency Challenge. His diligence contributed to his unit’s repeated successes in this Challenge, achieving Silver and Gold awards.

Danish exemplifies what it means to excel as a student of CCKSS. He holds true to the CCKSS Student Creed, striving “to excel in work and in play, when the tide is for (him), or against (him)”. We are immensely proud of Danish and we wish him every success!

### Grow – Story of Personal Excellence

**MANASSEH PAUL CRISPUS** (Class 4-1)

     style="width:25%">
		 
For Manasseh, a disappointing preliminary examination result was the wake-up call. That disappointment made him take a hard look at what he was doing and what he was not doing.

“I wasn’t taking the exams seriously,” he reflected. He realised his teachers had given him all the tools he needed to succeed but he had not made use of them. Manasseh took responsibility for the disappointing result and buckled down to some ‘serious studying’. He dug up the notes his teachers had provided and went through them all over again. He redid assignments given and reviewed what he did not get right before. Acknowledging that he did not learn well on his own, he roped in study partners. “It helps me to study with friends or in a group as it helps me remember. Plus, we can exchange information,” he said. 

He did not let the fact that part one of the GCE N-Level Examination was barely a month away deter him. He believed he could improve if he worked hard enough. He participated actively in class discussions and asked questions to clarify any doubts he had. He was receptive to feedback, listening with an open mind and taking steps to improve himself.

His perseverance paid off. On the day of the release of the N-level results, Manasseh was able to stand proud. The Principal cited him as an example of a student who embodied the school motto of ‘Grow’. 

However, his success was not only the result of ‘last minute work’. It was his attitude that made the difference, a willingness to learn and grow from adversity. This was something that his teachers had observed. His form teacher described Manasseh as a student who had initiative and resourcefulness. He was able to see the different aspects of a situation, understood what was required to address the issue and took the necessary steps to achieve the desired outcomes.

When asked, Manasseh denied he had done anything special, saying others had more impressive results. He may not think his achievement is worth mentioning but what Manasseh did is something we could all aspire to – to grow, to get better.
