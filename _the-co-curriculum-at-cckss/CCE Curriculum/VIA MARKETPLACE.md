<p>Values in Action (VIA) programme is a project-based learning approach
that uses a simplified Design Thinking Framework (Feel, Imagine, Do and
Share) that aims to develop <strong>problem-solving skills, empathetic thinking and critical and creative thinking </strong>in
CCKSians. Students will develop their creative thinking by using this approach
to tackle the needs related to the immediate and external community.</p>
<p>VIA Marketplace was created as a centralized platform where students can
explore various Values-in-Action (VIA) opportunities, making it easier
for students to discover and engage with our long-term VIA partners. The
Marketplace highlights opportunities in the different categories; Environment,
Children, Elderly, and Community. It aims to simplify the process of researching
and engaging the organisations that matches their interests. It is also
an opportunity for students to challenge themselves to contribute to new
organizations and broadening their community service experience.</p>
<p>VIA Marketplace creates opportunities in encouraging students to sign
up as volunteers and enabling them to make student-initiated contributions
to the community beyond the school-initiated VIA programme. This will build
students’ sense of civic responsibility and encourage future engagement
to serve the community and insiping others to participate and contribute
with the belief that it will create a positive ripple effect to society.</p>
