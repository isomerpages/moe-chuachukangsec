<h3><strong>Sri Nagarindra The Princess Mother School (SWPY), Phayao, Thailand</strong></h3>
<p>Continuing the partnership our Principal, Mr Timothy Cheng, built almost
a decade ago, our collaboration with Sri Nagarindra The Princess Mother
School (SWPY) was forged in 2023 with the school's inaugural Global Connect
Programme. Since then, we have welcomed students and staff from SWPY and
have gone to Chiang Rai Thailand with our students to learn from each other
and perform a VIA activity at Banrongpor Primary School where we refurbished
their school library and painted the surrounding structures. This meaningful
partnership was also taken up together with Mr Cheng's former school, Bukit
Merah Secondary School. We enjoy hosting our friends from SWPY and always
feel a sense of homecoming each time we touch down in Chiang Rai!</p>

<h3><strong>Phusangwittayakhom School, Phayao, Thailand</strong></h3>
<p>We were visited by the Principal and staff of Phusangwittayakhom School,
where we spent some time learning about the Thai and Singaporean education
systems. Miss Patumrat Khamsaen, the Director of the school once taught
at SWPY and believed that her teachers would benefit from a visit to Chua
Chu Kang Secondary School. The teachers from Phusangwittayakhom School
learnt more about virtual reality in education from their CCKSS counterparts
and the visit ended on a positive note with an MOU signed between both
schools.</p>

<h3><strong>Shinkamigoto Town Board of Education, Nagasaki, Japan</strong></h3>
<p>We have enjoyed visits from students and staff of the Shinkamigoto Town
Board of Education since 2023. Students from both schools have collaborated
together on VR in education games as well as orchid hybridisation crafts.
In 2024, we enjoyed exploring the Chua Chu Kang neighbourhood together
and look forward to perhaps visiting our Japanese friends soon!</p>

<h3><strong>Seongnam Foreign Language School, South Korea</strong></h3>
<p>We hosted staff and students of Seongnam Foreign Language School, South
Korea, as part of a cluster activity and enjoyed the time we spent with
them at CCKSS. In addition to learning about orchid hybridisation, we bonded
with our new friends over VR in education and a hearty local breakfast!</p>
