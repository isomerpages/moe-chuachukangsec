<h2><strong>2024 Global Connect Trip to Yogyakarta, Indonesia</strong></h2>
<p>Our first day in Yogyakarta was a heartwarming and unforgettable experience.
We visited the Aminah&nbsp; Al Maa’uun Orphanage in the southern region
of Yogyakarta. The warm welcome we received, complete with heartfelt hospitality
and open arms, set the tone for our day. The children residing in the orphanage
delighted us with a performance featuring songs accompanied by the rhythmic
beats of traditional tambourines. We had the chance to interact with the
children, aged between five and fifteen, creating a bond through fun activities
like playing games such as "Duck and Goose."</p>
<p>We also introduced them to Singapore's four official languages—Malay,
Chinese, Tamil, and English. Their enthusiasm was contagious, and our secondary
3 mentors, who had meticulously prepared for the session, taught with great
confidence. The day ended with traditional games like<em> chapteh</em> and <em>sepak takraw</em> for
the boys, while the girls enjoyed <em>batu seremban</em>. These activities
aimed to foster camaraderie and spark joy among the children. We left with
a commitment to continue this meaningful connection and build upon the
values of global citizenship through future collaborations.</p>
<p>Our journey through Yogyakarta’s rich history and culture took us to the
ancient temples of Prambanan and Borobudur. At Prambanan, we braved the
sweltering heat to marvel at the intricate architecture. In contrast, a
gentle drizzle accompanied our visit to Borobudur, adding a magical touch
to the experience. The breathtaking views of lush green rice fields and
towering mountains along the way further enriched our adventure.</p>
<p>We also explored the iconic Keraton Yogyakarta, the palace of the Sultan,
which holds immense historical significance as the heart of Yogyakarta's
identity. Visits to the Vradenburg Museum and Sonobudoyo Museum provided
deeper insights into the region's fascinating cultural heritage. We also
visited the old city of Yogyakarta, Kota Gede and captured a memorable
photo in front of the mosque built by Sultan Hamengkubuwono.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A delightful highlight of our trip was learning to make <em>nasi tumpeng</em>,
a traditional Javanese dish rich in cultural symbolism. The cone-shaped
yellow rice represents prosperity, while its shape mimics the volcanoes
surrounding Yogyakarta, symbolizing gratitude to the divine. This unique
experience included a group competition to decorate the <em>tumpeng</em>,
with our creations judged by a professional chef from a prestigious hotel.
The joy and creativity involved in this activity made it a memorable part
of our visit.</p>
<p>One of the most enriching experiences was our visit to SMP Negeri 5 Yogyakarta,
a school known for its outstanding achievements in academics and extracurricular
activities. We felt honored to witness the flag-raising ceremony, officiated
by alumnus Anies Baswedan, well known politician as the GOH who was inaugurating
the school’s new indoor stadium. The discipline and precision of the students
left us in awe.</p>
<p>Following the ceremony, we were treated to traditional dance performances
and invited to join in the fun. In return, we showcased a traditional Malay
dance infused with Hip-Hop elements, along with a rendition of <em>Orang Singapura</em>,
a song composed by Singapore's national anthem writer, Zubir Said. The
students responded with rousing applause.&nbsp;Additionally, we had the
opportunity to learn to play traditional gamelan music, fostering a deeper
appreciation for Javanese culture.</p>
<p>This visit was more than an exchange of performances; it was the beginning
of meaningful friendships with the students and teachers. We look forward
to hosting them in Singapore in the future for collaborative activities
at Chua Chu Kang Secondary School. We also formed close bonds with the
students, who were incredibly friendly and gave us insights into the Indonesian
education system.</p>
<p>Before returning home, we couldn’t resist shopping for souvenirs. From
beautiful batik shirts and fabrics to the local delicacy, <em>Bakpia</em>,
we brought back cherished memories of Yogyakarta. Overall, our trip was
a perfect blend of cultural immersion, historical exploration, and meaningful
connections. The warmth and hospitality of Yogyakarta will forever remain
in our hearts.</p>
