<h1><strong>2025 Global Connect Trip to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong></h1>
<p>For a group of Secondary 3 CCKSians, a 5-day, 4-night trip from 30 May
to 2 June to Ho Chi Minh City turned into a journey far beyond sightseeing.
It was an experience that awakened their senses, broadened their horizons,
and left lasting impressions of history, culture, and compassion. Excitement
buzzed through the group as they landed in Vietnam’s largest and most dynamic
city. The vibrant streets of Ho Chi Minh City—with their motorbike-filled
roads, food stalls, and colonial architecture was something completely
different from Singapore.</p>
<p>History students were brought back in time as they ventured to the Cu
Chi Tunnels, a vast underground network used during the Vietnam War. Crawling
through the narrow tunnels and seeing booby traps and hidden bunkers gave
them a raw and sobering understanding of the hardships endured during wartime.
Visits to the Presidential Palace and the War Remnants Museum offered insight
into Vietnam’s turbulent past, highlighting the resilience of its people.
These visits further deepened their understanding of the country’s complex
history and inspired reflections that lasted well beyond the museum walls.</p>
<p>The highlight for many was a visit to a beautiful organic farm outside
the city. There, under the guidance of Vietnamese chefs, our CCKSians learned
to cook traditional dishes like fresh spring rolls for their lunch. Divided
into teams, they took part in a mini cooking competition. Laughter echoed
through the kitchen area as groups worked together to chop herbs, stir
broths, and perfect their plating. The experience was not just about food,
but teamwork, creativity, and cultural immersion. There was also the opportunity
to experience padi farming and from the pictures sent by the teachers,
it was certainly a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Our CCKSians also enjoyed a scenic boat ride to the Mekong Delta where
they were able to see coconut-candy made live and even got to sample a
few flavours! Seeing the Vietnamese countryside was a very unique experience
for our CCKSians as they are used to the hustle and bustle of Singapore's
busy lifestyle. The quiet and serene surroundings were a welcome break!</p>
<p>An important learning experience was a visit to the Que Hong Humanitarian
Centre. Prepared with small gifts and simple games, our CCKSians spent
quality time engaging with the children—playing games, reading and generally
having fun. The visit was eye-opening and emotional. While some CCKSians
were initially shy, warmth and joy quickly took over. Bonds were formed,
and many left with a deeper appreciation for what they had and a new desire
to give back to the larger community in the future.</p>
<p>As the trip came to an end, the group shared stories and highlights over
their final Vietnamese meal and a surprise birthday celebration!. Each
CCKSian had grown—not just as travelers, but as individuals. They had navigated
a new city, tasted unfamiliar foods, walked through history, and connected
across language and culture. For many, this was their first time abroad
without family. They returned home more independent, more aware, and more
inspired. This 5-day adventure in Ho Chi Minh City was far more than a
school trip. It was a journey of personal discovery—blending learning with
fun, service with culture, and challenge with joy. For this group of 15-year-olds,
it marked the beginning of seeing the world not just as a destination,
but as a place of stories, connections, and endless possibility.</p>

<h1><strong>2024 Global Connect Trip to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong></h1>
<p>Our CCKSians embarked on an exciting 5 Days and 4 Nights trip to history-rich
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from 26 to 30 October 2024. Exploring Vietnam’s
tumultuous war history, they trekked through the Cu Chi Tunnels, visited
the hidden bunkers, War Remnants Museum and The Presidential Palace. Visiting
these historical sites offered our CCKSians rich first-hand knowledge that
until then only existed in the pages of their history textbooks.</p>
<p>They also hopped on a boat in the Mekong Delta, visiting My Tho where
they made friends with the wildlife and learned how to fish traditionally
with a more than 90% success rate! Lasting memories were made amongst much
laughter and camaraderie. Riding a motorised tuk-tuk with glimpses of rural
Vietnam and tasting traditional coconut candy made the experience more
memorable.</p>
<p>Ben Tahn Market was a favourite stop where CCKSians could see traditional
Vietnamese hawker stalls jostling for space with souvenir and coffee stalls.
They learned the fine art of bargaining and traded information on where
to get the best buys!</p>
<p>Our CCKSians also interacted with their counterparts from Inspire School
and exchanged information about each other’s countries, customs and festivals.
As the interaction time drew to a close, we reluctantly bid farewell to
our new friends and hope to see them soon! The next day, our CCKsians prepared
to visit Maison Chance, a non-profit organisation aimed to help its disadvantaged
beneficiaries learn the necessary skills to reintegrate society with dignity.
Everyone had a great time playing with traditional Singapore games and
learning how to communicate with one another through simple English and
Vietnamese.</p>
