<h2><strong>2024 Global Connect Trip to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong></h2>
<p>Our CCKSians embarked on an exciting 5 Days and 4 Nights trip to history-rich
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam from 26 to 30 October 2024. Exploring Vietnam’s
tumultuous war history, they trekked through the Cu Chi Tunnels, visited
the hidden bunkers, War Remnants Museum and The Presidential Palace. Visiting
these historical sites offered our CCKSians rich first-hand knowledge that
until then only existed in the pages of their history textbooks.</p>
<p>They also hopped on a boat in the Mekong Delta, visiting My Tho where
they made friends with the wildlife and learned how to fish traditionally
with a more than 90% success rate! Lasting memories were made amongst much
laughter and camaraderie. Riding a motorised tuk-tuk with glimpses of rural
Vietnam and tasting traditional coconut candy made the experience more
memorable.</p>
<p>Ben Tahn Market was a favourite stop where CCKSians could see traditional
Vietnamese hawker stalls jostling for space with souvenir and coffee stalls.
They learned the fine art of bargaining and traded information on where
to get the best buys!</p>
<p>Our CCKSians also interacted with their counterparts from Inspire School
and exchanged information about each other’s countries, customs and festivals.
As the interaction time drew to a close, we reluctantly bid farewell to
our new friends and hope to see them soon! The next day, our CCKsians prepared
to visit Maison Chance, a non-profit organisation aimed to help its disadvantaged
beneficiaries learn the necessary skills to reintegrate society with dignity.
Everyone had a great time playing with traditional Singapore games and
learning how to communicate with one another through simple English and
Vietnamese.</p>
