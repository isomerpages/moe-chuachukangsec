<h2><strong>2024 Global Connect Trip to Jiangsu Province, China</strong></h2>
<p>From 7 to 12 Nov 2024, a group of 37 CCKSians and 6 staff embarked on
a trip to Suzhou and Shanghai. On Day 1, we touched down at Shanghai Pudong
Airport and visited the Shanghai Maglev Museum, followed by an exciting
ride on the high-speed Maglev train, which was an experience of a lifetime.
On Day 2, we visited out partner school Zhangjiagang Experimental School,
where we were welcomed with much hospitality. Our students sat in classes
with their buddies and were awed by the enthusiasm displayed by our counterparts
in co-creating a participatory learning environment. Some of our students
had the chance to visit Zhangjiagang Liangfeng International School while
another group visited Zhangjiagang Children's Welfare Institute to learn
more about the social welfare service in China.</p>
<p>We had much cultural exposure through participation in club activities
at Zhangjiagang Experimental School, including Chinese poetry, painting
and dance. We also visited cultural sites such as the Humble Adminstratorâ€™s
Garden, Hanshan Temple and Tiger Hill at Suzhou. We have learnt that Suzhou
is famous for its gardens and embroidery craft, and we had a chance to
attend an embroidery class<strong> </strong>for a hands-on experience<strong> </strong>at<strong> </strong>the
Suzhou Embroidery Research Institute, where we also got to view highly
exquisite works produced by experts.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, we took an elevator to the top of the Shanghai Tower on the
118<sup>th</sup> floor for a panoramic view of Shanghai and an appreciation
in town planning. We also had the opportunity to watch a world class acrobatic
performance which kept us high on adrenaline. We visited famous sites such
as the Chenghuang Temple commercial area, Yu Garden and saw the breathtaking
night view of the Bund.</p>
<p>On the last day, we visited the Shanghai Natural History Museum where
we enjoyed engaging displays of natural history. As we bade farewell to
China, we appreciated the wonderful memories, friendships forged as well
as a growth in knowledge, confidence and other invaluable experiences.</p>
