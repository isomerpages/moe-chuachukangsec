<h2><strong>2025 Global Connect Trip to Jiangsu Province, China</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Enriching Horizons: Our Students' Educational Journey to China</strong>
</p>
<p>Our recent six-day educational trip to China proved to be an invaluable
learning experience for our students, combining industrial exposure, cultural
immersion, and historical appreciation from 4-10 November.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Learning and Innovation</strong>
</p>
<p>The journey began with an enlightening visit to SAIC Volkswagen Automotive
Co Ltd in Shanghai, where students observed modern manufacturing processes
in the body and stamping workshops. This hands-on exposure to automotive
production provided practical insights into industrial engineering and
sustainable manufacturing practices.</p>
<p>In Zhangjiagang, students explored Jiangsu CorEnergy Semiconductor Co.,
gaining understanding of cutting-edge semiconductor technology. The visit
to Shenhao Technology Co. in Hangzhou's Dream Town further expanded their
knowledge of China's thriving tech ecosystem, demonstrating how innovation
hubs foster entrepreneurship and technological advancement.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Immersion and Heritage</strong>
</p>
<p>Students experienced China's rich cultural tapestry through visits to
iconic sites including the Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou, West
Lake in Hangzhou, and the historic Wansong Academy. The UNESCO World Heritage
Grand Canal visit provided valuable lessons in historical preservation
and cultural significance.</p>
<p>Evening cultural activities, including the spectacular "Song Dynasty"
performance and ERA acrobatic show, offered students authentic glimpses
into Chinese artistic traditions whilst exploring vibrant areas like Nanjing
Road, Tianzifang, and Xintiandi.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection and Growth</strong>
</p>
<p>Daily debrief sessions encouraged students to process their experiences,
fostering critical thinking about cultural differences, industrial practices,
and global perspectives. The Longjing Tea Plantation visit and exploration
of traditional streets like Qinghefang provided opportunities to appreciate
China's agricultural heritage and local craftsmanship.</p>
<p>This comprehensive educational experience has undoubtedly broadened our
students' global awareness, enhanced their understanding of international
business practices, and deepened their appreciation for cultural diversity—preparing
them to become informed global citizens.</p>

<h2><strong>2024 Global Connect Trip to Jiangsu Province, China</strong></h2>
<p>From 7 to 12 Nov 2024, a group of 37 CCKSians and 6 staff embarked on
a trip to Suzhou and Shanghai. On Day 1, we touched down at Shanghai Pudong
Airport and visited the Shanghai Maglev Museum, followed by an exciting
ride on the high-speed Maglev train, which was an experience of a lifetime.
On Day 2, we visited out partner school Zhangjiagang Experimental School,
where we were welcomed with much hospitality. Our students sat in classes
with their buddies and were awed by the enthusiasm displayed by our counterparts
in co-creating a participatory learning environment. Some of our students
had the chance to visit Zhangjiagang Liangfeng International School while
another group visited Zhangjiagang Children's Welfare Institute to learn
more about the social welfare service in China.</p>
<p>We had much cultural exposure through participation in club activities
at Zhangjiagang Experimental School, including Chinese poetry, painting
and dance. We also visited cultural sites such as the Humble Adminstrator’s
Garden, Hanshan Temple and Tiger Hill at Suzhou. We have learnt that Suzhou
is famous for its gardens and embroidery craft, and we had a chance to
attend an embroidery class<strong> </strong>for a hands-on experience<strong> </strong>at<strong> </strong>the
Suzhou Embroidery Research Institute, where we also got to view highly
exquisite works produced by experts.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, we took an elevator to the top of the Shanghai Tower on the
118<sup>th</sup> floor for a panoramic view of Shanghai and an appreciation
in town planning. We also had the opportunity to watch a world class acrobatic
performance which kept us high on adrenaline. We visited famous sites such
as the Chenghuang Temple commercial area, Yu Garden and saw the breathtaking
night view of the Bund.</p>
<p>On the last day, we visited the Shanghai Natural History Museum where
we enjoyed engaging displays of natural history. As we bade farewell to
China, we appreciated the wonderful memories, friendships forged as well
as a growth in knowledge, confidence and other invaluable experiences.</p>
