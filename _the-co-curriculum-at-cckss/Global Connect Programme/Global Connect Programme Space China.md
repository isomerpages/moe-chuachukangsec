<h4><strong>Zhangjiagang 张家港</strong></h4>
<p>We have established a partnership with Zhangjiagang Experimental School
as part of our China trips, and we have also hosted their delegation in
Singapore. Zhangjiagang is a key industrial and port city in China, strategically
located along the Yangtze River. It is known for its strong economy, thriving
industries such as textiles, chemicals, and high-end equipment manufacturing,
as well as its rapid growth in new energy sectors. The city places a strong
emphasis on high-quality development and plays a vital role in international
trade, particularly through the Zhangjiagang Bonded Zone.</p>

<h3><strong>Wherever you go, go with all your heart</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Wúlùn nǐ qù dào nǎlǐ, dōu yào quánxīn quányì de qù</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The quote <strong><em>“Wherever you go, go with all your heart”</em></strong> by
Confucius reflects the importance of sincerity, dedication, and wholehearted
effort in everything we do. It encourages us to be fully present in each
moment and to pursue our goals or journeys with passion and integrity.
Rather than approaching life passively or half-heartedly, Confucius reminds
us to commit ourselves genuinely, whether in learning, relationships, or
new experiences. This timeless message continues to inspire people around
the world to live with purpose, courage, and authenticity.</p>

<h3><strong>Traveling ten thousand miles is better than reading ten thousand books</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Xíng wàn lǐ lù, shèng dú wàn juǎn shū</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The proverb <strong><em>“Travelling ten thousand miles is better than reading ten thousand books,"</em></strong> highlights
the idea that while books offer knowledge and wisdom, real-life experiences
provide deeper understanding and true insight. By exploring the world,
observing different cultures, and encountering people from various backgrounds,
one gains lessons that cannot be fully learned from books alone. This saying
encourages learning through action, experience, and discovery.</p>

<h3><strong>Travel makes people humble. You realize how vast the world is and how small you are.</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Lǚxíng ràng rén qiānbēi, nǐ huì fāxiàn shìjiè zhī dà, zìjǐ zhī miǎoxiǎo</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The saying <strong><em>“Travel makes people humble; you discover how vast the world is and how small you are”</em></strong> reminds
us that travel broadens our perspective. When we step outside our familiar
surroundings, we encounter cultures, landscapes, and ways of life far beyond
our own. This experience helps us realise that our personal worries and
achievements are just a tiny part of a much larger world. Travel teaches
humility, encourages open-mindedness, and inspires us to appreciate the
beauty and diversity of life.</p>

<h3><strong>The world is so big, I want to go and see it</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Shìjiè nàme dà, wǒ xiǎng qù kànkàn</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This quote <strong>“The world is so big, I want to go and see it," </strong>expresses
a simple yet powerful desire to explore beyond the familiar and discover
the beauty, diversity, and possibilities that the world offers. It reflects
a spirit of curiosity, freedom, and courage to step out of one’s comfort
zone and experience life more fully.</p>
