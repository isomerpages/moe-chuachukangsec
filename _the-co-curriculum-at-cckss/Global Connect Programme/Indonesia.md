<h1><strong>2025 Global Connect Trip to Yogyakarta, Indonesia</strong></h1>
<p>Five days. Four nights. One unforgettable adventure. Yogyakarta for our
CCKSians was a journey through culture, kindness, and curiosity. Yogyakarta
opened its arms and gently unfolded a world far richer than any classroom
could offer. A trip once marked on calendars with excitement turned out
to be an immersion into the soul of Java—a blend of heritage, humility,
and hands-on wonder.</p>
<p>From the moment their feet touched Yogyakarta’s soil, our CCKSians sensed
something different. The pace here was gentler, the smiles were warmer
and the streets told stories in batik patterns, shadow puppets, and the
aroma of <em>gudeg</em> simmering in the air. Our CCKSians visited the Sultan’s
Water Palace, or <em>Taman Sari</em>. Labyrinthine tunnels, peaceful courtyards,
and echoes of the past surrounded them as they imagined royal life centuries
ago. Just a short walk away stood <em>Kraton Yogyakarta</em>, the royal
palace still inhabited by the sultan’s family. History wasn’t confined
to glass cases here—it lived in the dance of gamelan music and the gentle
cadence of the Javanese language.</p>
<p>The temples of Yogyakarta don’t just stand—they <em>rise</em> and so did
our CCKSians! Despite the downpour (which happened to last year's group
too!) our CCKSians, armed with their ponchos and customised footwear, climbed
in near silence as they explored the temple. Each carved stone, each Buddha
statue told a story of devotion, of centuries, of something greater than
words. Later, <em>Prambanan</em> stunned with its soaring towers and Hindu
epics carved into stone. For our CCKSians, it was certainly an eye-opening
experience as such temples do not exist in Singapore!</p>
<p>All that travelling makes one hungry! In a breezy outdoor kitchen, our
CCKSians tied on aprons for a Javanese cooking workshop. They pounded spices
with mortars and pestles, folded banana leaves, and stirred bubbling woks.
The reward? Their very own <em>nasi goreng</em> and <em>tempeh</em> dishes—shared
at long wooden tables, filled with pride. Another exciting experience which
many, if not all, CCKSians have never experienced was rice padi farming!
At a nearby rice padi, the students were handed traditional conical hats
and taught the art—and labor—of planting rice. Mud squished between their
toes as laughter filled the air, balanced with moments of real awe at the
farmers’ skills.</p>
<p>Our CCKSians also visited the Aminah Al Maa'uun Orphanage where connections
were formed not through language, but through simple joys—playing football,
traditional games and sharing smiles. Our CCKSians also enjoyed their visit
to SMPN 5, where they met their counterparts and were treated to a spectacular
welcome. Through joint activities, music, and games, they found common
ground in laughter and curiosity. As they boarded the plane home, suitcases
were heavier—but hearts even more so. Each student carried something invisible:
a deeper sense of place, purpose, and possibility. Yogyakarta was not just
a simple school trip. It was a journey of respect—for heritage, for people,
and for the planet. It was muddy feet and open hearts, quiet temples and
lively kitchens, shared meals and shared stories. And for our CCKSians,
it wasn’t just about where they went. It was about who they became.</p>

<h1><strong>2024 Global Connect Trip to Yogyakarta, Indonesia</strong></h1>
<p>Our first day in Yogyakarta was a heartwarming and unforgettable experience.
We visited the Aminah&nbsp; Al Maa’uun Orphanage in the southern region
of Yogyakarta. The warm welcome we received, complete with heartfelt hospitality
and open arms, set the tone for our day. The children residing in the orphanage
delighted us with a performance featuring songs accompanied by the rhythmic
beats of traditional tambourines. We had the chance to interact with the
children, aged between five and fifteen, creating a bond through fun activities
like playing games such as "Duck and Goose."</p>
<p>We also introduced them to Singapore's four official languages—Malay,
Chinese, Tamil, and English. Their enthusiasm was contagious, and our secondary
3 mentors, who had meticulously prepared for the session, taught with great
confidence. The day ended with traditional games like<em> chapteh</em> and <em>sepak takraw</em> for
the boys, while the girls enjoyed <em>batu seremban</em>. These activities
aimed to foster camaraderie and spark joy among the children. We left with
a commitment to continue this meaningful connection and build upon the
values of global citizenship through future collaborations.</p>
<p>Our journey through Yogyakarta’s rich history and culture took us to the
ancient temples of Prambanan and Borobudur. At Prambanan, we braved the
sweltering heat to marvel at the intricate architecture. In contrast, a
gentle drizzle accompanied our visit to Borobudur, adding a magical touch
to the experience. The breathtaking views of lush green rice fields and
towering mountains along the way further enriched our adventure.</p>
<p>We also explored the iconic Keraton Yogyakarta, the palace of the Sultan,
which holds immense historical significance as the heart of Yogyakarta's
identity. Visits to the Vradenburg Museum and Sonobudoyo Museum provided
deeper insights into the region's fascinating cultural heritage. We also
visited the old city of Yogyakarta, Kota Gede and captured a memorable
photo in front of the mosque built by Sultan Hamengkubuwono.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A delightful highlight of our trip was learning to make <em>nasi tumpeng</em>,
a traditional Javanese dish rich in cultural symbolism. The cone-shaped
yellow rice represents prosperity, while its shape mimics the volcanoes
surrounding Yogyakarta, symbolizing gratitude to the divine. This unique
experience included a group competition to decorate the <em>tumpeng</em>,
with our creations judged by a professional chef from a prestigious hotel.
The joy and creativity involved in this activity made it a memorable part
of our visit.</p>
<p>One of the most enriching experiences was our visit to SMP Negeri 5 Yogyakarta,
a school known for its outstanding achievements in academics and extracurricular
activities. We felt honored to witness the flag-raising ceremony, officiated
by alumnus Anies Baswedan, well known politician as the GOH who was inaugurating
the school’s new indoor stadium. The discipline and precision of the students
left us in awe.</p>
<p>Following the ceremony, we were treated to traditional dance performances
and invited to join in the fun. In return, we showcased a traditional Malay
dance infused with Hip-Hop elements, along with a rendition of <em>Orang Singapura</em>,
a song composed by Singapore's national anthem writer, Zubir Said. The
students responded with rousing applause.&nbsp;Additionally, we had the
opportunity to learn to play traditional gamelan music, fostering a deeper
appreciation for Javanese culture.</p>
<p>This visit was more than an exchange of performances; it was the beginning
of meaningful friendships with the students and teachers. We look forward
to hosting them in Singapore in the future for collaborative activities
at Chua Chu Kang Secondary School. We also formed close bonds with the
students, who were incredibly friendly and gave us insights into the Indonesian
education system.</p>
<p>Before returning home, we couldn’t resist shopping for souvenirs. From
beautiful batik shirts and fabrics to the local delicacy, <em>Bakpia</em>,
we brought back cherished memories of Yogyakarta. Overall, our trip was
a perfect blend of cultural immersion, historical exploration, and meaningful
connections. The warmth and hospitality of Yogyakarta will forever remain
in our hearts.</p>
