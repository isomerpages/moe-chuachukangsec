<h2><strong>2025 Global Connect Trip to Chiang Rai, Thailand</strong></h2>
<p>Our largest overseas learning journey to date unfolded over six days and
five nights in Chiang Rai, Thailand, where 62 students and 9 staff embarked
on a comprehensive cultural and community engagement experience. With the
cohort split between two partner institutions—Srinagarindra The Princess
Mother School (SWPY) and Phusangwittayakhom School (PWK)—the programme
offered an exceptional opportunity to appreciate northern Thai culture,
heritage, and traditions.</p>
<p>At both partner schools, our students were warmly welcomed by the Thai
educators and students. Instead of traditional classroom immersion, the
itinerary focused on a structured series of cultural appreciation workshops
designed to deepen understanding of the customs and practices of the Chiang
Rai region. Students participated in Loy Krathong crafting to learn the
significance of this important festival, created Lanna lanterns to explore
the symbolism of light in Lanna culture, and engaged in Muay Thai fitness
sessions that introduced them to key techniques of Thailand’s national
martial art. They also prepared the traditional Khanom Tian dessert and
experienced the Sabad Chai Victory Drum, gaining deeper appreciation of
its ceremonial importance. These workshops allowed students to develop
meaningful interactions with local peers while experiencing Thai artistic,
culinary, and performance traditions firsthand.</p>
<p>Beyond the school-based activities, the group explored several of Chiang
Rai’s most notable cultural and historical sites. At the White Temple (Wat
Rong Khun), students observed the intricate craftsmanship and contemporary
symbolism embedded in its architecture. The Blue Temple (Wat Rong Suea
Ten) offered a vivid display of modern sacred design, while the Chiang
Rai Skywalk provided sweeping views of the Mekong River and the surrounding
borderlands. Visits to the Mae Sai Border and the Golden Triangle exposed
students to the dynamics of cross-border exchange and the historical significance
of this tri-border region. A respectful visit to the Long Neck Village
introduced students to the heritage and artistic traditions of the Karen
ethnic community.</p>
<p>A particularly memorable component of the journey was the hands-on culinary
experience at Suwanee Cooking School. Here, students learned to prepare
Pad Thai and Tom Yam soup, gaining practical exposure to foundational Thai
cooking techniques and flavour profiles. Many expressed pride in being
able to create full dishes from scratch under the guidance of local instructors.</p>
<p>Managing an overseas trip of this scale, involving 62 students and 9 staff,
was a significant milestone for the school. The students demonstrated adaptability,
cooperation, and respect throughout the journey, contributing to a smooth
and enriching experience for all. This 6D5N Chiang Rai immersion strengthened
ties with SWPY and PWK, deepened students’ appreciation of Thai culture,
and reinforced the value of overseas experiential learning. It remains
a meaningful and formative chapter in their development as globally aware
and culturally confident learners.</p>

<h2><strong>2024 Global Connect Trip to Chiang Rai, Thailand</strong></h2>
<p>Our recent 6 days 5 nights overseas trip to Chiang Rai, Thailand was an
enriching and unforgettable experience. Known for its stunning landscapes
and cultural landmarks, Chiang Rai offered the perfect backdrop for learning
and exploration.</p>
<p>The journey began with a warm welcome from our partner school, Srinagarindra
The Princess Mother School (SWPY) where we had the opportunity to engage
in cultural exchange, fostering friendships and understanding between students
from both countries. Activities included joint workshops, where we learned
about traditional Thai crafts, music, and dance, enhancing our appreciation
of local traditions.</p>
<p>A highlight of the trip was visiting the iconic landmarks of Chiang Rai.
We explored the stunning <strong>Wat Rong Khun (White Temple)</strong>,
renowned for its intricate architecture. Another memorable stop was the <strong>Golden Triangle</strong>,
a historical site where the borders of Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar meet.</p>
<p>The trip also included a visit to the <strong>Long Neck Villages</strong>,
where students learned about the diverse ethnic communities in the region,
gaining insights into their unique lifestyles and traditions.</p>
<p>Apart from sightseeing, the trip emphasized personal growth. Students
embraced the challenges of adapting to a new environment, building resilience
and confidence in the process. The shared experiences brought everyone
closer, creating bonds that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>This journey to Chiang Rai was not just a geographical excursion but a
meaningful cultural exchange and learning opportunity. It left all participants
with cherished memories and a deeper appreciation for the beauty and diversity
of Thailand.</p>

<h2><strong>2023 Global Connect Trip to Chiang Rai, Thailand</strong></h2>
<p>Our first ever batch of CCKSians embarked on the school's first overseas
trip in November 2023 to Chiang Rai, Thailand. We were excited to bring
our Student Councillors to visit their counterparts at Srinagarindra The
Princess Mother School Chiang Rai (SWPY) where they we were very warmly
welcomed by the staff and students.</p>
<p>The trip was a journey of growth for our CCKSians as they learnt more
about themselves and their areas of strength and growth. The highlight
of the trip was the interaction with SWPY's students and with the young
students of Ban Rong Por Primary School where we worked in partnership
with Bukit Merah Secondary School to refurbish the school's library. After
Bukit Merah completed the painting, our CCKSians came the following week
to install shelving, furniture and books to create a cosy and lovely reading
space.</p>
<p>Prior to the trip, our CCKSians spent time using Design Thinking to conceptualise
how best to maximise the space to create a conducive learning and reading
space for the Ban Ron Por students. They enthusiastically checked in with
their primary schools and got preloved books which they sorted out on site.
Looking at the happy faces of our young friends, we are glad that our contribution
made a positive impact on their lives.</p>
<p>Our CCKSians also got to enjoy quality time with their SWPY peers learning
how to make <em>Loy Krathongs</em> and lanterns which were the highlight
of the night's festivities. They also enjoyed a drumming lesson, <em>Muay Thai</em> and
learnt how to make delicious coconut jelly!</p>
<p>After interacting with their peers, they had fun exploring Chiang Rai's
sights and sounds, visiting the sky walk, White Temple, Golden Triangle
and border region as well as an exciting cooking class where they learnt
how to make Pad Thai and Tom Yum soup!</p>
<p>It was certainly a memorable trip which they will remember for a long
time! Join us next year for the 2024 trip!</p>
