<p>The CCKSS Global Connect Overseas programme (CGC) is the school's platform
to develop <strong>effective communicators and active contributors with civic, cross-cultural and global literacy</strong>.</p>
<p>We embarked on our first overseas trip to Chiang Rai, Thailand in 2023
and since then, we have scaled up our offering to <strong>4 countries - Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and China</strong> to
our Sec 3 CCKSians. In 2026, we are proud to offer <strong>5 trips to 4 countries - China, Japan, Indonesia and Thailand.</strong>
</p>
<p>Overseas experiences allow for authentic learning to <strong>broaden students’ learning experiences</strong> and <strong>deepen students’ acquisition of 21CC</strong>.
These will enable students to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>deepen skills in working with people from a diverse range of socio-cultural&nbsp;
backgrounds beyond Singapore;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>engage overseas counterparts in new and unfamiliar contexts (in the form
of school immersion and student exchange programmes); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understand Singapore’s responses to its unique challenges, constraints
and vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants on the trip enjoyed making new friends with their overseas
counterparts and learnt to be more resilient, respectful and more understanding
towards their peers.</p>
