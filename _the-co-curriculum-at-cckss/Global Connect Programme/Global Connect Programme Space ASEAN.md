<p>Singapore has long maintained strong connections with the ASEAN region.
These ties form a key pillar of its foreign policy, supported by shared
histories and cultural links with neighbouring countries. As ASEAN’s middle
class grows and its youthful population drives development, the region
is expected to become the world’s fourth-largest economy by 2030. This
transformation will create new possibilities for Singaporeans and local
businesses to engage, grow, and broaden their perspectives. Strengthening
regional relationships also enables Singapore to better navigate global
political and economic uncertainties.</p>
<p>In this context, it is essential for CCKSians to understand how closely
Singapore’s future is linked to ASEAN. They should feel confident interacting
with peers from neighbouring countries and be inspired to take part in
regional opportunities. As such, CCKSS Global Connect trips within the
region offer meaningful ways for CCKSians to learn about ASEAN cultures
firsthand, deepen their awareness, and build friendships beyond borders.</p>

<h4><strong>CCKSS Global Connect Chiang Rai, Thailand</strong></h4>
<p>Chiang Rai, the northernmost province of Thailand, is home to a diverse
population that includes various hill tribes and communities of Chinese
descent. Its history stretches back to the 7th century, and in 1262, it
became the first capital of the Lanna Kingdom. Geographically, Chiang Rai
shares borders with Myanmar to the north and Laos to the east, with the
point where the three countries meet famously known as the “Golden Triangle.”
While the region was once a major center for opium production, royal initiatives
helped transform local livelihoods by educating residents and promoting
sustainable alternatives.</p>
<p>Unlike Thailand’s more bustling cities, Chiang Rai maintains a quieter,
more relaxed atmosphere. This slower pace has allowed the area to grow
while preserving its traditional way of life. Many community development
efforts focus on helping rural areas build tourism opportunities that protect
their cultural and natural heritage. For CCKSians, Chiang Rai offers a
meaningful chance to engage with Thai traditions, learn about the region’s
rich history, and explore the outdoors in an authentic setting.</p>

<h4><strong>CCKSS Global Connect Yogyakarta, Indonesia</strong></h4>
<p>Yogyakarta, often affectionately called “Jogja,” is considered the cultural
soul of Indonesia. It is celebrated worldwide for its rich traditions in
Javanese arts, literature, and architecture. The city is home to the famous
Borobudur Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in the world and a UNESCO
World Heritage Site. Nearby stands another iconic landmark, the Prambanan
Temple complex, an important Hindu site.</p>
<p>Beyond its cultural heritage, Yogyakarta is a major centre of education
in Indonesia, hosting more than a hundred higher learning institutions
– the highest number in any province. Among them is Gadjah Mada University,
one of the country’s most renowned universities. For CCKSians, a trip to
Yogyakarta offers a unique chance to experience Indonesia’s cultural richness,
immerse in local traditions, and engage in meaningful outdoor learning.</p>

<h4><strong>CCKSS Global Connect Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong></h4>
<p>Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), formerly known as Saigon, is Vietnam’s economic
engine and the leading city of the southern region. HCMC aims to transform
into a major national hub for finance, commerce, science, and technology,
driving the country’s industrialisation and modernisation. As part of this
vision, the city is working towards becoming a smart city, with a focus
on digital infrastructure and technological innovation.</p>
<p>Beyond its economic and technological progress, the city and its surrounding
areas offer meaningful educational experiences. CCKSians can explore Vietnam’s
tumultous political and wartime history at the Cu Chi Tunnels, Reunification
Palace and War Remembrance Museum. They can also experience rice planting
and food sustainability at a natural farm-to-table restaurant. A visit
to HCMC gives CCKSians a firsthand look at Vietnam’s rapid economic growth,
dynamic start-up ecosystem, and rich historical and cultural heritage.</p>
