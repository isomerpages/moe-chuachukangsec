<p>Singapore has long maintained strong connections with the ASEAN region.
These ties form a key pillar of its foreign policy, supported by shared
histories and cultural links with neighbouring countries. As ASEAN’s middle
class grows and its youthful population drives development, the region
is expected to become the world’s fourth-largest economy by 2030. This
transformation will create new possibilities for Singaporeans and local
businesses to engage, grow, and broaden their perspectives. Strengthening
regional relationships also enables Singapore to better navigate global
political and economic uncertainties.</p>

<h3><strong>The ASEAN Corner Table Art:</strong></h3>
<p>It is essential for CCKSians to understand how closely Singapore’s future
is linked to ASEAN. They should feel confident interacting with peers from
neighbouring countries and be inspired to take part in regional opportunities.
As such, CCKSS Global Connect trips within the region offer meaningful
ways for CCKSians to learn about ASEAN cultures firsthand, deepen their
awareness, and build friendships beyond borders.</p>

<h4><strong>CCKSS Global Connect Chiang Rai, Thailand</strong></h4>
<p>Chiang Rai, the northernmost province of Thailand, is home to a diverse
population that includes various hill tribes and communities of Chinese
descent. Its history stretches back to the 7th century, and in 1262, it
became the first capital of the Lanna Kingdom. Geographically, Chiang Rai
shares borders with Myanmar to the north and Laos to the east, with the
point where the three countries meet famously known as the “Golden Triangle.”
While the region was once a major center for opium production, royal initiatives
helped transform local livelihoods by educating residents and promoting
sustainable alternatives.</p>
<p>Unlike Thailand’s more bustling cities, Chiang Rai maintains a quieter,
more relaxed atmosphere. This slower pace has allowed the area to grow
while preserving its traditional way of life. Many community development
efforts focus on helping rural areas build tourism opportunities that protect
their cultural and natural heritage. For CCKSians, Chiang Rai offers a
meaningful chance to engage with Thai traditions, learn about the region’s
rich history, and explore the outdoors in an authentic setting.</p>

<h4><strong>CCKSS Global Connect Yogyakarta, Indonesia</strong></h4>
<p>Yogyakarta, often affectionately called “Jogja,” is considered the cultural
soul of Indonesia. It is celebrated worldwide for its rich traditions in
Javanese arts, literature, and architecture. The city is home to the famous
Borobudur Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in the world and a UNESCO
World Heritage Site. Nearby stands another iconic landmark, the Prambanan
Temple complex, an important Hindu site.</p>
<p>Beyond its cultural heritage, Yogyakarta is a major centre of education
in Indonesia, hosting more than a hundred higher learning institutions
– the highest number in any province. Among them is Gadjah Mada University,
one of the country’s most renowned universities. For CCKSians, a trip to
Yogyakarta offers a unique chance to experience Indonesia’s cultural richness,
immerse in local traditions, and engage in meaningful outdoor learning.</p>

<h4><strong>CCKSS Global Connect Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong></h4>
<p>Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), formerly known as Saigon, is Vietnam’s economic
engine and the leading city of the southern region. HCMC aims to transform
into a major national hub for finance, commerce, science, and technology,
driving the country’s industrialisation and modernisation. As part of this
vision, the city is working towards becoming a smart city, with a focus
on digital infrastructure and technological innovation.</p>
<p>Beyond its economic and technological progress, the city and its surrounding
areas offer meaningful educational experiences. CCKSians can explore Vietnam’s
tumultous political and wartime history at the Cu Chi Tunnels, Reunification
Palace and War Remembrance Museum. They can also experience rice planting
and food sustainability at a natural farm-to-table restaurant. A visit
to HCMC gives CCKSians a firsthand look at Vietnam’s rapid economic growth,
dynamic start-up ecosystem, and rich historical and cultural heritage.</p>

<h3><strong>The world is too wide to stay in the same place (โลกกว้างเกินกว่าจะอยู่ที่เดิม)</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Lôhk gwâang gern gwàa jà yùu thîi derm</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The phrase <strong><em>“The world is too wide to stay in the same place”</em></strong> encourages
us to explore beyond our comfort zone. It reminds us that life is full
of opportunities, cultures, and experiences waiting to be discovered. Staying
in one place—physically or mentally—limits our growth. By stepping out
and seeing the world, we learn more about others, and about ourselves.</p>

<h3><strong>The more you travel, the more you understand the world (ยิ่งเดินทาง ยิ่งเข้าใจโลก)</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Yîng dern-thaang, yîng khâo-jai lôhk</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The saying <strong><em>“The more you travel, the more you understand the world”</em></strong> reminds
us that travel is not just about seeing new places, but about opening our
minds and hearts. When we travel, we experience different cultures, beliefs,
and ways of life. This helps us realise that the world is much bigger than
our daily routines and personal viewpoints. Travel teaches understanding
and humility. It shows us how people live differently, yet share similar
hopes and struggles. We begin to appreciate diversity and become more empathetic
and open-minded. At the same time, travel helps us discover more about
ourselves—our strengths, limits, and dreams. In the end, the more we explore
the world, the more we grow in wisdom, perspective, and self-awareness.</p>

<h3><strong>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step</strong></h3>
<p>The saying<em> </em><strong><em>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step,”</em></strong> teaches
us the importance of starting, no matter how big or difficult something
may seem. Many dreams, goals, or life changes can feel overwhelming at
first, but this quote reminds us that every meaningful achievement is built
from small, consistent actions. The first step may seem small or insignificant,
but it is the most important because it moves us from intention to reality.
Without it, no progress can begin. This saying encourages courage, patience,
and persistence. It tells us not to be afraid of slow progress, as long
as we keep moving forward. Success is not achieved overnight—it is a journey
made up of effort, discipline, and determination, one step at a time.</p>

<h3><strong>The world is so big, I want to go and see it</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Shìjiè nàme dà, wǒ xiǎng qù kànkàn</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This quote <strong>“The world is so big, I want to go and see it," </strong>expresses
a simple yet powerful desire to explore beyond the familiar and discover
the beauty, diversity, and possibilities that the world offers. It reflects
a spirit of curiosity, freedom, and courage to step out of one’s comfort
zone and experience life more fully.</p>
