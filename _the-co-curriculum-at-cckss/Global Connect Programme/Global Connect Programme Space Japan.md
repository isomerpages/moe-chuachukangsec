<h4><strong>Shinkamigoto しんかみごとう</strong></h4>
<p>The Shinkamigoto Board of Education sends a group of students from its
high schools on a learning trip to Singapore every year. In 2025, we felt
that the time was right to send our students to Shinkamigoto and embarked
on a recce trip with the goal of sending the first batch of CCKSians in
2026.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Shinkamigoto from here:</p>

</p>
<h4><strong>Sasebo させぼ</strong></h4>
<p>Sasebo was on the return leg of our ferry journey from Shinkamigoto before
we boarded a train to Fukuoka. Due to its strategic location and geographic
proximity to Korea and China, Sasebo Naval District was founded in 1889
and played a key role as a forward operating base during the First Sino-Japanese
and Russo-Japanese Wars. Sasebo today is also home to US warships as part
of the US Fleet Activities Sasebo, which was formed in 1946.</p>

<h4><strong>Fukuoka ふくおか</strong></h4>
<p>Fukuoka, located on the northern shore of Japan’s Kyushu Island, is a
vibrant city where modern urban life meets rich tradition. Known for its
welcoming atmosphere, Fukuoka offers historic temples, and scenic coastal
views. It’s also a culinary hotspot, famous for its Hakata ramen and lively
street food stalls. With its mild climate, convenient transportation, and
blend of culture, food, and nature, Fukuoka is a gateway to the charm of
southern Japan.</p>

<h4><strong>Nagasaki ながさき</strong></h4>
<p>Located along the western edge of Kyushu in southwestern Japan, Nagasaki
Prefecture is made up of both mainland areas and a vast collection of islands
scattered along its coast. With its position facing the sea and framed
by mountains, the region is famous for breathtaking sunsets over clear
blue waters. Nagasaki also offers a peaceful island lifestyle and is renowned
across Japan for its wide selection of incredibly fresh seafood.</p>
<p>Nagasaki is also known for its resilience. Nagasaki's Christians endured
persecution during the Edo period, it also overcame an atomic bombing during
World War II and the eruption of nearby Mount Unzen. Due to the rich learning
opportunities for our CCKSians, Nagasaki is definitely a city which they
will visit during their trip to Japan in 2026.</p>

<h3><strong>Every new place is a chance to discover a new you</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>A-ta-ra-shii ba-sho wa a-ta-ra-shii ji-bun o mi-tsu-ke-ru chan-su</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Japan is a country where every region feels like stepping into a different
world, making the quote <strong><em>“Every new place is a chance to discover a new you”</em></strong> especially
fitting. From the futuristic energy of Tokyo’s neon streets to the quiet
Zen gardens of Kyoto, from snowy Hokkaido landscapes to subtropical Okinawa
beaches, each destination invites travelers to see and feel differently.
The blend of ancient tradition with cutting-edge modernity encourages reflection,
growth, and fresh perspectives. In Japan, exploring a new place isn’t just
sightseeing—it’s a chance to rediscover yourself in ways you never expected.</p>

<h3><strong>Nagasaki is a place where the past and the future quietly intersect</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Nagasaki wa, kako to mirai ga shizuka ni kōsa suru basho</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Nagasaki truly embodies the idea that <strong><em>“the past and the future quietly intersect.”</em></strong> Once
a gateway to foreign influence during Japan’s period of isolation, it carries
deep memories of cultural exchange, Christian heritage, and the profound
scars of the atomic bombing. Yet today, Nagasaki is also a vibrant, forward-looking
city—alive with innovation, global connections, and youthful energy. Walking
its streets, you can feel layers of history resting gently alongside modern
life, where quiet temples and old trading posts stand not far from bustling
harbors and shining towers. In Nagasaki, the weight of the past and the
promise of the future coexist in harmony, inviting visitors to pause and
reflect.</p>

<h3><strong>The taste of travel is the heart of the land</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Lǚxíng ràng rén qiānbēi, nǐ huì fāxiàn shìjiè zhī dà, zìjǐ zhī miǎoxiǎo</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>“The taste of travel is the heart of the land”</em></strong> feels
especially true in these regions of Kyushu. In <strong>Nagasaki</strong>,
every dish tells a story of cultural exchange, from centuries-old Chinese
and Dutch influences to the comforting flavors of champon noodles. In the <strong>Goto Islands and Shinkamigoto</strong>,
simple yet soulful meals—freshly caught fish, handmade udon, or traditional
kamaboko—reflect the close bond between the people and the sea that sustains
them. Meanwhile, <strong>Fukuoka</strong> shines as a modern culinary hub,
where steaming bowls of Hakata ramen and lively yatai street stalls embody
the city’s warmth, energy, and hospitality. Together, these places show
how food is more than flavor—it is a direct expression of history, community,
and spirit.</p>

<h3><strong>Travel is nourishment for the soul</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Tabi wa kokoro no eiyō de aru</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>“Travel is nourishment for the soul”</em> </strong>beautifully
captures the essence of visiting Shinkamigoto and the Goto Islands. These
remote islands offer a slower rhythm of life, where unspoiled coastlines,
hidden churches, and quiet fishing villages invite visitors to breathe
deeply and reconnect with themselves. The natural beauty of the turquoise
seas and star-filled skies, combined with the warmth of the island communities,
gives travelers a sense of renewal that goes beyond sightseeing. In the
Goto Islands, each journey feels like a retreat for the heart, feeding
the spirit with peace, reflection, and simple joys that linger long after
you leave.</p>
