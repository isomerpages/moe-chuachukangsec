<h1><strong>2026 MOE-OBS Challenge Programme (MOC)</strong></h1>
<p>Our Secondary 3 students will be participating in the <strong>MOE-OBS Challenge Programme (MOC)</strong> in
2026. The MOC programme offers a unique opportunity for our students. As
part of the National Outdoor Adventure Education Masterplan, the MOC programme
seeks to develop ruggedness, resilience and build cohesion amongst youths.
During the OBS course, students undergo a shared Outdoor Adventure Learning
(OAL) experience and are provided opportunities to learn to work together
in new, challenging, and authentic situations with their peers to overcome
various challenges.</p>
<h4><strong>Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The MOC programme for the school will take place from <strong>03 to 07 August 2026</strong>.
The MOC will offer our students unique opportunities to work together with
students from other schools to overcome various team challenges using the
outdoors as the ‘classroom’.&nbsp; Through this course, they &nbsp;will
learn to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>manage challenges through self-directed learning and make informed choices;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>appreciate the natural heritage of Singapore and recognise that everyone
plays a part.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The MOC is part of the curriculum, and every secondary 3 student is expected
to attend the programme unless he/she has valid reasons for not doing so
e.g. a medical condition preventing safe participation.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Safety</strong></h4>
<p>OBS has an excellent safety record built on stringent requirements from
its international network of Outward Bound centres around the world. The
MOC has been designed with safety in mind, where accredited instructors
and registered nurses work together to ensure your child’s safety during
the programme.</p>
<p>All parents of each participant will be required to submit a medical declaration
form as part of the registration for the programme. A qualified doctor
will also be engaged to verify and confirm the medical status of each participant
with the follow-ups for participants who need further verification.</p>
