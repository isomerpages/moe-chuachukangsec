<h1><strong>Student Council</strong></h1>
<h3>1. The Student Council</h3>
<p>The School's Student Council comprises a body of student leaders elected
by their teachers and peers for their exemplary conduct.&nbsp; Not only
are these students role models, they are also servant leaders.&nbsp; They
help the school in various programmes and activities like parents-teachers-meeting,
Speech Day, orientations etc.&nbsp; They also play a disciplinary role
and help to remind fellow students of their conduct and behaviour.&nbsp;
Outside of the school, they are emissaries of the school and the Student
Council Badge they wear is symbolic of that status endowed upon them.</p>
