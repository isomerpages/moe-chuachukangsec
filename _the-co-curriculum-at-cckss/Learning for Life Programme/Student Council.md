<p>The pinnacle of Student Leadership opportunities in Chua Chu Kang Secondary
School is to serve in the Student Council. As exemplary leaders, Student
Councillors serve responsibly and they are adaptable. They are reflective
learners and they always uphold the school values. The curriculum for the
Student Council is undergirded by Kouzes and Posner’s The Leadership Challenge.
At the end of their tenure as Student Councillors, every Councillor is
expected to exhibit each of the 5 Practices.</p>
