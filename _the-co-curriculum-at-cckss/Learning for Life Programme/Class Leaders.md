<h1><strong>Class Leaders</strong></h1>
<p>Class leaders are the beacon of each class: rallying the students together
and encouraging participation from the class. They form the Class Committee
with the Peer Support Leaders to support the Form Teachers in carrying
out tasks and planning small events.</p>
<p>In support of Form Teachers, the Class Leaders:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</ul>

<h1><strong>Class Leaders' Appointment Ceremony 2025</strong></h1>
<p>On 6 February, Class Leaders and Peer Support Leaders were officially
appointed, stepping into their roles as Tier 2 Leaders dedicated to fostering
a positive and supportive class culture. They affirmed their commitment
to guiding their peers and upholding school values. Each Class Chairperson
delivered their own take on how their class could achieve its goals through
our school values: Respect, Resilience, Integrity, Care, and Enterprise.
Their speeches reflected unique aspirations, from building stronger class
unity through mutual respect to demonstrating resilience in overcoming
challenges together. They emphasized integrity in daily actions, the importance
of caring for one another, and the spirit of enterprise in taking initiative
and striving for excellence.</p>
