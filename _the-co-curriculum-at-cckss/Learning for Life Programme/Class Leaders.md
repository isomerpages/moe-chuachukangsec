<h2><strong>Class Leaders</strong></h2>
<p>Class leaders are the beacon of each class: rallying the students together
and encouraging participation from the class. They form the Class Committee
with the Peer Support Leaders to support the Form Teachers in carrying
out tasks and planning small events.</p>
<p>In support of Form Teachers, the Class Leaders:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

class spirit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor the class in the absence of teachers/ during Self-directed Learning
periods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report incidents in class and speaks up about unfair situations (i.e.
be an upstander).</p>
</li>
</ul>
