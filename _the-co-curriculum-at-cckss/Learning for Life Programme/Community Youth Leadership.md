<h2><strong>Community Youth Leadership</strong></h2>
<p>In Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, we envision our leaders to be Forward-looking
young adults who empathise with others. We strive to be an open community
of leaders who learn together, share and care for one another.</p>
<p>Community Youth Leadership programmes impact different communities whom
have been selected by Student Leaders. These events hold valuable experiential
learning opportunities for the student leaders to apply their skills.</p>
