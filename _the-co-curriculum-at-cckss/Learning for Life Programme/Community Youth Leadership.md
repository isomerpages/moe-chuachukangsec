<h2><strong>Community Youth Leadership</strong></h2>
<p>In Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, we envision our leaders to be Forward-looking
young adults who empathise with others. We strive to be an open community
of leaders who learn together, share and care for one another.</p>
<p>Community Youth Leadership programmes impact different communities whom
have been selected by Student Leaders. These events hold valuable experiential
learning opportunities for the student leaders to apply their skills.</p>

<p>In line with our school’s Applied Learning Programme: Sustainable Living
for a Resilient Future, our Student Leaders embarked on efforts to learn
how to grow vegetables with Explicit Teaching by a group of students from
the National University of Singapore. With this experience, our Student
Leaders shared their success and learnings during the National Day Carnival
at Chua Chu Kang Community Centre with the residents of Chua Chu Kang!</p>
