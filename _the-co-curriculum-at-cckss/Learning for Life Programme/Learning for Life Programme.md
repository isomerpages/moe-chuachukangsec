## Serve to Lead, Lead to Serve

To lead, one must first learn to serve. We believe leaders are humble, act with integrity and must have their heart in the right place. This understanding will pave the way for you to grow and become effective leaders beyond school. 

During Student Leadership Development you experience the 5Es – Explicit Teaching, Experiential Learning, Empowerment, Effective Reflection and Evaluation – and learn what it means to lead. Our philosophy? Everyone can lead.  

And it’s not all just ‘head’ knowledge.’ There are ample opportunities for you to grow as leaders – be it as leaders for class projects or for self-initiated endeavours under the Youth-For-Causes programme, class committee members, leaders in your co-curricular activities, National Education (NE) ambassadors, Peer Support Leaders or as Student Councillors. 

These platforms provide valuable experience for student leaders to enact what they have learnt as seniors, take on the task of organising school events and mentor their juniors along the way. In and outside of the classroom, teachers guide and empower you to put theory into practice. With effective feedback from teachers and your peers, and your own reflection, you will grow in your own leadership journey, to become exemplary leaders who serve others with excellence and pride.
