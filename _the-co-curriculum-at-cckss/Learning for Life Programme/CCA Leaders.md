<h1><strong>Leadership Development Through CCA</strong></h1>
<p>Student leaders are the most critical element in creating the vibrancy
within our Co-Curricular Activities (CCA). These student leaders (CCA leaders)
are able to lead their juniors, organize CCA activities on their own and
motivate their team members to help the CCA achieve greater heights. In
the process, they hone their skills, confidence and competency to become
better leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Facilitating Leadership Development in CCAs</strong></h4>
<p>Each CCA has an organizational structure with clear roles and responsibilities
for its CCA leaders. Teachers in charge of the CCAs would also build in
the necessary training and mentoring processes to ensure that the students
appointed into leadership roles are well-equipped to do the job. A clear
reporting structure of each CCA student leadership committee is set with
specific teachers-in-charge who serve as advisors. The teachers also conduct
a review session with the student leaders after the completion of major
student-led activities.</p>
