Chua Chu Kang Secondary School and Teck Whye Secondary School merged in 2023 to become a new school – Chua Chu Kang Secondary (德惠中学). Building upon the strengths of both schools in the areas of uniformed groups, sports, performing arts, Applied Learning Programmes (Robotics &amp; Automation, Sustainable Urban Design) and Learning For Life Programme (LLP), the new school will be able to provide a greater variety of rich learning experiences for its students. Becoming one family also offers opportunities for teachers in both schools to synergise their best practices, design lessons even more innovatively and enhance students’ learning further. With this robust synergy, the new Chua Chu Kang Secondary School (德惠中学) looks to grow from strength to strength as students experience the best of both worlds from an upsized learning experience!
