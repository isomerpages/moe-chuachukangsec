<p>Following Singapore’s independence in 1965, the nation was faced with
the immediate need to address its economic survival. As a result, education
became survival-driven. National integration was also seen as a key condition
for economic survival and bilingualism inevitably became a key component
in Singapore’s education system. This would lead to the creation of integrated
schools which would offer education in English and Mother Tongue. At the
same time, there was also a higher demand for secondary school places due
to the growth of Singapore’s population.</p>
<p>In this landscape, Jalan Teck Whye Secondary School was the second integrated
school to be established in the Teck Whye neighbourhood and provided education
in English, Mandarin and Malay. It was officially opened on 11 September
1967 by then Minister for Education Ong Pang Boon and Parliamentary Secretary
to the Ministry of Finance Tang See Chim, signalling the synergistic partnership
between education and economic development.</p>
<p>During this period of humble beginnings, the school worked on building
its identity and progressively built up its Extra Curricular Activities
(ECA) to encourage integration amongst students from the different races
and streams. Concurrently the school also improved its infrastructure to
create a more conducive learning environment for students.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Pioneering Years (1980 – 2001)</strong></h3>
<p>By the end of the 1970s, Singapore’s stellar economic progress signalled
a need for the nation to transit from a labour-intensive to a capital-intensive
economy. Efficiency-driven education in the form of a national curriculum
with a stress on bilingualism, civics and moral education as well as an
emphasis on science, mathematics and technical education was unveiled.</p>
<p>Renamed to Teck Whye Secondary School in 1980, the school responded to
the change by encouraging staff development and promoting computer literacy.
Programmes put in place to promote bilingualism and ECAs continued to provide
a good platform for the integration of students from different racial groups.
The school also improved its infrastructure to enhance the learning experience
of its students.</p>
<p>In addition, the school strongly believed in bringing out its students’
greatest potential so that they would grow up into good and useful citizens.
Embarking on a two-pronged approach of community-oriented self-development
to inculcate values in young Teck Whyeans, the school was also able to
leverage on its dedicated staff to also help its more challenging students
return to a more purposeful path.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Transformative Years (2002 – 2016)</strong></h3>

<p>With the advent of the “Thinking Schools Learning Nation” ability-driven
education model to help Singapore transition towards a knowledge-based
economy in 1997, there was greater flexibility and choice offered to students.
Streams were no longer rigid barriers and schools were given the flexibility
to offer options that matched student interests. Schools were strongly
encouraged to take ownership of the curriculum and co-curricular activities
to better respond to student talents and abilities and to customise their
programmes to meet student aptitudes and skills.</p>
<p>In 2002, Teck Whye moved into its new premises at Teck Whye Crescent.
With a larger campus and better facilities, the school was ready to step
up to the challenge of responding to the demands of providing an ability-driven
education to its students. To herald this new chapter in the history of
the school, the school mission, vision, uniform, school crest and colours
were changed. Teck Whye’s transformative years are an exciting period where
students benefitted from the school’s commitment to make available a plethora
of opportunities to develop them holistically.</p>
<p>Curriculum innovation was encouraged with departments offering talent
development programmes which allowed students to appreciate learning and
challenge themselves to excel.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Student-Centric Values-Driven Education initiative was launched
to better deliver a holistic and values-driven education and comprised
of key programmes and activities to instil deep values in students, build
deep foundations for learning, provide broad, inclusive and holistic education
and encourage learning for life. Many initiatives were launched by the
school to meet these outcomes and students benefited from programmes that
aimed to develop them in the physical, cognitive, aesthetic, social-moral
and leadership domains.</p>
<p>Niche areas were also built up to attract talent to the school and students
were exposed to learning platforms that developed them holistically and
inculcated lifelong learning. To ensure that students would develop deep
values, even stronger community bonds were built through the introduction
of a community-based Values in Action programme where students partnered
the community to reach out to residents in need.</p>
<p>With the seeds planted by pioneering educators and the flowers lovingly
cared for by subsequent generations, Teck Whye will continue to bloom with
pride for many years to come.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Innovative Years (2019 - 2022)</strong></h3>
<p>The Innovative Years brought about rich student-centric experiences, strengthened
teacher-student relationships and promoted the joy of learning. Learning
was also transformed when the school pioneered one-to-one learning devices
in 2019, enabling more students to have access to rich online content,
enhancing their learning experiences. With such innovations, Covid-19 failed
to dampen our spirits as the whole school supported one another through
the pandemic and lived by our motto: To Strive And Not To Yield. As testament
to the school's ability to pivot and adapt to the new normal, it was featured
in Channel News Asia's Documentary, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/our-new-normal/our-new-normal-1446211" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">"Education in the New Normal"</a>
</p>
<p>Undeterred by the challenges of Covid-19, the school also embarked on
pedagogical innovations where applied learning in the form of Knowledge
Building was woven into the History curriculum. In recognition of such
efforts, the school was awarded the Outstanding Knowledge Building School
Award in 2019.</p>

<p>Learning was also transformed when the school pioneered one-to-one learning
devices and upgraded our physical spaces including DRSUF (Design &amp;
Research Space for Urban Farming), the Virtex Room for Virtual Reality
Learning, Indoor Sports Hall and the School Library. All these further
enhanced our students’ learning experiences in Teck Whye.</p>

<p>In addition, pre-Covid, cohort-based internationalisation trips to Southeast
Asian helped to sensitise students to ASEAN - a fast growing, dynamic and
vibrant region.</p>

<p>Student Development and National Education programmes became more experiential
in nature with students enjoying National Day picnics with their classes
in Singapore's iconic sites like Gardens by the Bay and Botanic Gardens.
Chinese New Year celebrations were also more vibrant with mass <em>lohei</em> sessions
conducted with the whole school.</p>

<p>As we end the chapter for Teck Whye Secondary School, we look forward
to new beginnings as the school merges with Chua Chu Kang Secondary School.
We will always look fondly upon the memories we have of 56 years of history
and are heartened that the school lives on in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School's
chinese name, 德惠中学.</p>
