Following Singapore’s independence in 1965, the nation was faced with the immediate need to address its economic survival. As a result, education became survival-driven. National integration was also seen as a key condition for economic survival and bilingualism inevitably became a key component in Singapore’s education system. This would lead to the creation of integrated schools which would offer education in English and Mother Tongue. At the same time, there was also a higher demand for secondary school places due to the growth of Singapore’s population.

In this landscape, Jalan Teck Whye Secondary School was the second integrated school to be established in the Teck Whye neighbourhood and provided education in English, Mandarin and Malay. It was officially opened on 11 September 1967 by then Minister for Education Ong Pang Boon and Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Tang See Chim, signalling the synergistic partnership between education and economic development.

During this period of humble beginnings, the school worked on building its identity and progressively built up its Extra Curricular Activities (ECA) to encourage integration amongst students from the different races and streams. Concurrently the school also improved its infrastructure to create a more conducive learning environment for students.

Our Pioneering Years (1980 – 2001) 

By the end of the 1970s, Singapore’s stellar economic progress signalled a need for the nation to transit from a labour-intensive to a capital-intensive economy. Efficiency-driven education in the form of a national curriculum with a stress on bilingualism, civics and moral education as well as an emphasis on science, mathematics and technical education was unveiled.

Renamed to Teck Whye Secondary School in 1980, the school responded to the change by encouraging staff development and promoting computer literacy. Programmes put in place to promote bilingualism and ECAs continued to provide a good platform for the integration of students from different racial groups. The school also improved its infrastructure to enhance the learning experience of its students.

In addition, the school strongly believed in bringing out its students’ greatest potential so that they would grow up into good and useful citizens. Embarking on a two-pronged approach of community-oriented self-development to inculcate values in young Teck Whyeans, the school was also able to leverage on its dedicated staff to also help its more challenging students return to a more purposeful path.
