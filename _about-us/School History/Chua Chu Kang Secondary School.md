Chua Chu Kang Secondary School was founded in 1992. Residents held fond memories of their farming days in the old Chua Chu Kang area, so the school took the name to reflect the ties that bind.

Founding Principal, Miss Sum Chee Wah, and 14 teachers welcomed the pioneer batch of students in 1993.  Faith that CCKsians will stand tall anchored the school as we embarked on providing vibrant formative experiences for our charges.  

The school Motto ‘Serve, Grow, Excel’ is a timeless beacon for all CCKsians. It encapsulates the staff’s shared ideals – every CCKsian will seek to Serve others before themselves, Grow in character, and Excel in all they undertake. The Students’ Creed ‘I am a CCKsian’ is a poetic call to character, for CCKsians to distinguish themselves no matter the tide.

On 8 April 1995, the school was officially opened by then Member of Parliament for Chua Chu Kang, Associate Professor Low Seow Chay. The first batch of CCKsians sat for the GCE O-Level and N-Level Examinations in 1996. Through the years, the school has grown from strength to strength, with accolades that bear testament to our unstinting belief in our students, and their will to soar.

Standing at the cusp of a very different new world and steered by our vision, the school established its strengths in Robotics & Automation and in Community Youth Leadership.

Under the helm of six Principals over three decades, Chua Chu Kang Secondary School has stayed true to its vision and mission. The merger of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School and Teck Whye Secondary School in 2023 holds great promise. As one school, we continue to chart the future of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School (德惠中学) and hold in stewardship the ideals of education.

# Our Past Principals
# Growth And Development Over The Years 

**Ms Sum Chee Wah**<br>
**Founding Principal, 1996 to 1999**
<br>In the school’s nascent years, founding Principal, Ms Sum Chee Wah, focused on engendering a strong sense of belonging among staff and students, quality school programmes to develop students holistically, and establishing the school’s good name in the Chua Chu Kang community. 

As we were a new school, Ms Sum rallied the pioneer batch of staff and students in forging the CCKSS identity and there was a strong sense of camaraderie. The school crest today, borne out of the aspirations of the pioneer batch of staff and students, encapsulates our collective belief in holistic education, lifelong learning and the desire for our students to embody and pass on the CCKSS spirit.

Ms Sum aspired CCKsians to be persons of good character, to become contributing members of society and to lead fulfilling lives. The philosophy undergirding the school Motto ‘Serve, Grow, Excel’ arose from this aspiration – for CCKsians to be involved in service to gain valuable insights and understanding about life and, through these learning experiences, for them to grow in character and to strive to become the best versions of themselves. 

As the foremost Principal, Ms Sum built a strong foundation from which the school can take flight and painted a vision for the school that staff and students identified with, one which we have faithfully honoured in the last three decades. 

**Mrs Teo Khin Hiang <br>
Principal, 1996 to 1999**
<br>Chua Chu Kang Secondary School was Mrs Teo Khin Hiang’s first posting as Principal. Character-building was central to education, and she called for CCKsians to be men and women of character and to distinguish themselves. 

Mrs Teo led staff and students in defining what it meant to be a CCKsian, her vision poetically crystallised in the Students’ Creed ‘I am a CCKsian’ which students recite till this day.

For students’ holistic development, the school embarked on its Aesthetics programme, instilling in CCKsians a love for music and the arts. We were one of the first few schools where students learnt to play the guitar during Music lessons. As a young school, we ventured into what few schools then did. ‘Oliver’, our first ever Musical, held at Victoria Theatre generated buzz, galvanised staff and students, and was testament to our belief that CCKsians were talented and can rise to the occasion. 

Mrs Teoh also championed service to the community, and it was during her time that the school initiated the collection of old newspapers to raise funds for needy students. Teachers led by example by volunteering at an elderly home in Bukit Batok.  

In 1999, under Mrs Teoh’s leadership, the school ranked 58 among all secondary schools in Singapore, no small achievement for a young school where CCKsians Serve, Grow and Excel! 


**Ms Rosalind Sim <br>
Principal, 2000 to 2009**
<br>Ms Rosalind Sim was our longest serving Principal. As Principal, Ms Sim envisioned Chua Chu Kang Secondary School to be a school of choice in the west. It was her belief that CCKsians can excel and stand tall among students from other established schools. Through quality programmes, CCKsians have more opportunities and choices, will grow in confidence and are poised to scale greater heights. It was this unwavering belief that rallied staff and students then. 

Firm, yet nurturing, Ms Sim steered the school in engendering a positive school tone, key to effective learning. A true educator, her profound words that ‘we have never really taught until the students have learnt’ called for teachers to be reflective practitioners and inspired the can-do spirit in us to go the extra mile, to teach our students well, to build in them a sense of pride and affiliation to the school and help them taste success. This journey would take time but we never lost sight of our goal. 

During Ms Sim’s stint as Principal, the classes of 2002 and 2003 did exceptionally well. Chua Chu Kang Secondary School made it to the Top 50 and then, the Top 20 value-added schools. The school attained the Sustained Achievement Award for Academic Value-Added and the Sustained Achievement Award for Aesthetics and Uniformed Groups. While these awards were encouraging, it was the successes of CCKsians, big and small, that affirmed our belief that every CCKsian can excel! 


**Mrs Chuah-Koh Eng Ngoh <br>
Principal, 2010 to 2014**
<br>As Principal, Mrs Chuah-Koh Eng Ngoh envisioned every CCKsian to be a blessing to others. She wanted CCKsians to stand tall for their academic and co-curricular achievements, be guided by a strong moral compass, to leave the school a better person, and to be contributing members of society. 

Under Mrs Chuah’s leadership, the school continued to do well. The school was placed on the Honours Roll of the Ministry of Education for our students’ value-added performance in the national examinations and we also attained the Character Development Award (DA). Our CCAs continued to put up a strong showing. Our Performing Arts and Uniformed Groups received the Sustained Achievement Awards and our Sepak Takraw boys were national champions in 2014. It was during Mrs Chuah’s stint when we began to chart our direction towards Robotics and Automation, and Student Leadership, as our Applied Learning Programme and Learning for Life Programme respectively.  

Mrs Chuah was caring and nurturing. She was always supportive, affirming and ready to lend a listening ear. She inspired teachers to give their best and rallied teachers to create meaningful learning experiences. For CCKsians, Mrs Chuah held the bar and expectations high so that they will always leave a legacy of distinction! 


**Mr Tan Keng Joo <br>
Principal, 2015 to 2019**
<br>Mr Tan Keng Joo was our fifth Principal. He led staff in refining the school’s vision into what it is today – A Community of Passionate Learners and Compassionate Leaders. Mr Tan believed in continuous improvement and rallied staff in reviewing the school’s processes for greater effectiveness. During Mr Tan’s stint, our Robotics and Automation Programme and Student Leadership Programme took form to drive the school’s vision. 

Mr Tan Keng Joo called for CCKsians to work hard and play hard. An accomplished potter and sportsman, Mr Tan believed in the all-round development of students. He was often seen playing with our students. Mr Tan wanted CCKsians to enjoy school and to have memorable school experiences.

During Mr Tan’s stint as Principal, we celebrated SG50. We also celebrated our Silver Jubilee.  Aladdin, the Musical, our very own production, was a feast for our senses and an unforgettable experience. And so was our Speech Day and Homecoming. Three Weddings and A Conversation was a meaningful celebration to commemorate Racial Harmony Day (RHD). Mr Ong Ye Kung, then Minister for Education, who was our Guest-of-Honour for RHD, also launched our Ceramic Wall. In addition, the school underwent a facelift. We now have the Scintilla, Expressio, Fortis, Vivace and the Arena, common spaces for our students to pursue their interests, develop their talents, and for enjoyment. Indeed, these years were a colourful and vibrant chapter.

In 2019, Mr Tan retired as Principal after 35 years in education. 

**Mdm Ong Liang Fung Adel <br>
Principal, 2020 to 2022**
<br>Mdm Adel Ong served as Principal from 2020 to 2022 and Chua Chu Kang Secondary School was her first posting as Principal. Her strong leadership, impact and influence were instrumental in steering the school through a time characterised by great changes.

In 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic took us by storm. As a young Principal, Mdm Ong was fearless and unflinching. She rallied staff and students to observe national safety protocols as well as instituted school processes to keep everyone safe from the scourge of COVID-19. During Circuit Breaker, Mdm Ong was personally involved and led the School Management Committee in establishing clear and robust systems for Home-Based Learning (HBL), and tapped on teachers’ ICT expertise, so that CCKsians can continue to learn in these difficult times.

Amidst the pandemic, Singapore schools went into one-to-one computing under the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP). This called for new systems and processes to be instituted in schools, not just in terms of the management and use of the Personal Learning Devices, but to embolden teachers and deepen our e-Pedagogy and use of ICT. To this end, Mdm Ong called for teachers to leverage the Student Learning Space Pedagogical Scaffold 2.0 and focused on ICT training to strengthen teachers’ competencies and to bring about greater student engagement in our classrooms. 

Through 2021 and in 2022, we readied ourselves for school merger. Mdm Ong called on teachers to ‘serve nationally’, putting students from both schools first in all our decisions pertaining to merger. 

Every ending marks a new beginning. 2022 was a year like no other. We looked back with pride and nostalgia, yet embraced uncertain but exciting times to come. Under Mdm Ong’s leadership, and with the labour of the entire CCKSS community, our Speech Day, Assemblage Art Installation, Sports Fiesta and Homecoming were events memorable and well-cherished by all staff and students. 

As this 30-year chapter of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School closes, and a new one of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School (德惠中学) begins, we thank Mdm Adel Ong for her faithful stewardship of the school.
