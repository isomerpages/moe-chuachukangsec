# **School History, Motto, Crest**

### School History  

The school started in 1992, with a staff of 10 teachers and the founding Principal, Miss Sum Chee Wah. The pioneer batch of 318 students joined the school in 1993, and they were placed in 5 Express and 3 Normal (Academic) classes. Most of the students were from the Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Batok and Bukit Panjang neighbourhood. The school motto, school badge and school song were crafted by the Principal, teachers and students.   

The school was officially opened on 8 April 1995 by Associate Professor Low Seow Chay. In 1996, Mrs Teo Khin Hiang took over the helm and the first batch of graduating students sat for the GCE 'O' and 'N' level examinations.

Ms Rosalind Sim took over as Principal in 1999. In 2003, the school was one of the Top 20 Value-Added schools. Under Ms Sim's leadership, the students continued to excel academically and in their co-curricular activities.

Mrs Chuah-Koh Eng Ngoh took over as Principal in 2010. In 2012, the school celebrated her 20th anniversary and produced a series of videos to commemorate the event. Under Mrs Chuah's leadership, the school developed a niche in the area of Youth and Community Leadership as the school's Learning for LIfe Programme.

Mr Tan Keng Joo took the helm of the school in 2015. Under his leadership, the school established its Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Robotics & Automation (R&A), to help our students develop 21st Century Competencies such as Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT). Under Mr Tan’s direction, the school building also underwent an extensive face-lift which included upgraded facilities to support the holistic development of students. These include the Scintilla, which has a Robotics Arena for R&A lessons, the Fortis, a well-equipped gymnasium to support students’ physical development, Vivace, a performance stage for students to showcase their talents, and the Ninja Challenge, an outdoor obstacle course to develop ruggedness in students. 

Our current principal, Mdm Ong Liang Fung, took over the leadership of the school in 2020.
