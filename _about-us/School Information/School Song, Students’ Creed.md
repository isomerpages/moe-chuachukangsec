# **School Song, Students’ Creed**

### School Song

In joy we celebrate our school   
To praise its honoured name   
As term by term and year by year    
We aim to play the game     

Chorus:   
_Serve Grow Excel_     
_Our motto for success_    
_Brings the honours home_     
_To our dear CCKS_ 

Serve, serve with hearts sincere   
Our school and nation fine    
Serving others before ourselves    
Let our sprits shine!

(Chorus)

Grow, grow so pure and strong   
In body, heart and mind    
Reaping rewards where we have sown    
Life’s treasures we shall find!

(Chorus)

Excelling at our work deserves   
Excelling at our play    
Raise our aims and score our goals    
Excel in every way!

(Chorus)

### STUDENTS’ CREED
I am a CCKSian.   
I seek to serve   
with kindness and humility,    
pride and loyalty.  

I am a CCKSian.   
I persevere to grow    
in courage, integrity,    
wisdom, knowledge and strength,      
in respect for others and myself,      
in understanding of my past     
and confidence in my future.   

I am a CCKSian.    
I strive to excel    
in work and in play,    
when the tide is for me,    
or against me,     
success my encouragement,     
failure my stepping stone    
and risk taking my natural way to learn.

I am a CCKSian.    
This is my creed, my code of honour.
