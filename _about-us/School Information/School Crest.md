<p>The school crest is designed to reflect and highlight the strengths and qualities of the former Teck Whye Secondary School and Chua Chu Kang Secondary School.</p><p>The flames (drawn from the former CCKSS crest’s torch) make up the acronym CCKSS (‘K’ being a composite of two ‘S’s) and symbolise the enduring spirit of the two schools merged as one.</p><p>The stars (drawn from the former TWSS crest’s guiding star) represent the school values that guide our students, portraying our students as trailblazers, sparks of excellence, and lights of influence and inspiration across diverse fields and within the community.</p><p>The different coloured strokes coming together and moving in the same direction represent our unity in diversity.</p><p>Turquoise, formed from a mix of blue and green, signifies the union of the two schools, blending their distinct strengths to forge a new and unique gem. Turquoise thus symbolises unity, synergy and the emergence of new possibilities, potential, and growth. Orange signifies optimism and energy, while red highlights our passion for life and learning, and our sense of commitment to the school, community, and nation.</p><p></p><h4>School Crest</h4><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2023 Design/School Crest/School_Crest.jpg"></div><p></p>
