<p><strong>School Rules</strong></p><p>The school believes that a positive school tone is critical to student learning and character development. CCKSians must learn the rationale for and the importance of school rules in creating a positive and conducive learning environment for all. School rules state the school’s expectations of student behaviour, which forms the basis of character development.</p><p><strong>Attendance and Punctuality</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>CCKSians attend school every school day.</p></li><li><p>If CCKSians are absent with a valid reason, they will present to their Form Teacher a medical certificate or a parent’s letter (for a non-medical reason) on the following school day. Failing which, the student would be deemed to be “Absent without Valid Reason”. This would also apply to school activities conducted outside of normal curriculum time. A maximum of 3 parents’ letters are allowed per student, per term.</p></li><li><p>CCKSians arrive punctually for the flag-raising ceremony at the beginning of each school day, for their lessons and all school events. If they are late, they will apologise for their tardiness to the Teacher-in-charge and explain their reason.</p></li><li><p>CCKSians do not leave the class, school or school events without seeking permission from the Teacher-in-charge. If they feel unwell during the school day and seek to leave the school early, they report to the General Office and the Office staff will contact their parents to take them home. If they wish to leave the school during school hours for a valid reason, they must first obtain permission from a HOD, Vice-Principal or the Principal. An Early Departure Form needs to be completed and submitted to the General Office.</p><p></p><p></p></li></ul><ol data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>General Appearance</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong>(a) Attire</strong></p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modifications to the uniform are not allowed (e.g. tapering of pants).
