<p>As we begin 2026, I am deeply grateful for the strong foundations laid
in the past year and for the collective efforts of our staff, students,
parents, and partners who journeyed together through a fulfilling 2025.
It was a year marked by perseverance, growth, and a shared commitment to
helping every CCKSian thrive — and these achievements now propel us forward
with confidence and hope.</p>
<p>At the heart of our school’s success are our dedicated staff, whose professionalism,
care, and unwavering commitment continue to shape lives beyond the classroom.
Each plays a vital role in shaping the experiences and opportunities our
students receive, and together, we form a community that believes deeply
in the potential of every learner entrusted to us. I am thankful for the
many unseen hours spent guiding, encouraging, and supporting our students
— helping them grow not only academically, but also in character, resilience,
and confidence. Together, our educators foster environments where students
feel safe to learn, motivated to improve, and inspired to pursue excellence.</p>
<p>Our students’ achievements in 2025 reflect this strong foundation of support
and belief. We are proud of our Robotics Club for emerging as Champions
of the National Robotics Competition, our Dance CCA for attaining Distinction
Awards at the Singapore Youth Festival, and our Uniformed Groups for achieving
the highest Unit Proficiency Awards. These accomplishments showcase not
only talent and hard work, but also teamwork, discipline, and perseverance
— values that define the CCKSian spirit.</p>
<p>We are equally grateful for the strong partnership of our parents, Parents
Support Group, School Advisory Committee, and community and industry partners.
Your trust, encouragement, and involvement enrich our students’ learning
experiences and strengthen our school community. Education thrives when
schools and families walk closely together, united by shared purpose and
commitment to holistic development.</p>
<p>As we move into 2026 with our school theme, <strong><em>Growing Together, Thriving Together</em></strong>,
we reaffirm our commitment to nurturing strong relationships, fostering
holistic growth, and creating a supportive environment where every learner
can flourish. We will continue to strengthen teaching and learning, prioritise
student well-being and character development, and empower our students
to take ownership of their learning and contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<p>Together, let us continue to inspire one another, grow in purpose, and
make a meaningful difference in the lives entrusted to us. I look forward
to another year of shared learning, growth, and success with the Chua Chu
Kang Secondary School community.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Growing Together, Thriving Together!</strong>
