Our guiding motto of **Serve, Grow and Excel** remains our timeless beacon, especially during times of adversity. 2020 was undeniably the year of new ‘abnormal’. The pandemic, although trying, has generated tremendous opportunities for growth, learning and risk-taking. It was astonishing to see the beauty of CCKSS human spirits emerging stronger amidst this crisis. We trail-blazed our own class-based CCA programme, highlighted as a good story in the Straits Times. Our teachers’ years of tinkering with Blended Learning was also being featured in MOE’s Schoolbag. Despite the challenges, our CCKsians continued to excel with our 4.1 student, Khairulazizi receiving the pinnacle Lee Kuan Yew For All Round Excellence Award and 15 Staff receiving MOE and National Awards in 2020.   

This adversity has magnified the strength of the human spirit, beauty of empathy and wonders that come with seizing opportunities.  

We enter 2021 with fresh resolve to **‘Run with Patience’** and strive **‘Onward and Upward’** in our endeavour to give our best to our students, premised on our school’s beliefs of **‘Student Our Focus’** and **‘People Our Interest’.** Our team of caring and dedicated staff continues to lead, care and inspire our students to be **Passionate Learners** and **Compassionate Leaders**. 

Our ALP Programme, **‘Robotics and Automation’** readies our students for the future as students immerse themselves in learning and tinkering with coding and programming skills in their R&A curriculum to design solutions that harness technology to solve human problems. Our LLP, **‘Community and Youth Leadership’**, develops students intentionally through our 5Es approach in equipping the minds, engaging the hearts and empowering the hands to make a difference to the community. We look forward to our implementation of **Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) and Blended Learning in 2021.** 

Our strong team of partners – Parents, School Advisory Committee and Alumni are always there with us to ride through every crest of wave in supporting all our initiatives and working hand in hand with us to help our children emerge stronger. We can only be more thankful. 

With Gratitude and Anticipation,
