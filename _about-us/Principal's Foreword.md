We began our journey as a merged school with the theme “Together, A New Beginning” in our first year, progressed to “Stronger Together” in the second year, and now, as we enter our third year, we proudly embrace the theme “Together We Excel!”

Reflecting on the first two years of our merged school, I am filled with gratitude for the growth, collaboration, and achievements we have shared. These successes would not have been possible without the unwavering support and dedication of our teachers, staff, and stakeholders. Together, we have truly lived out the spirit of our 2024 school theme, Stronger Together.

The year 2024 marked a significant milestone as we fully integrated into a single campus, bringing together all our Secondary 1 to 5 students. With a safe and inclusive environment as our foundation, we remain steadfast in our mission to nurture the holistic well-being and growth of our students. Beyond academic excellence, we strive to equip our students with the values, skills, and knowledge they need to fulfill their potential and inspire them to make meaningful contributions to the community.

The achievements of our CCKSians reflect not only their hard work but also the dedication of our staff. Education is more than just academic results; it is about cultivating life skills, values, and character. Through Co-Curricular Activities, academic programmes, and a wide range of enriching experiences, our students have forged lifelong friendships and created lasting memories.

Our staff members, the cornerstone of the CCKSian family, have demonstrated excellence and unwavering commitment to the school and the community. Their contributions were nationally recognized, with several receiving National Day Awards for their outstanding service. Professional development initiatives, including learning journeys to explore innovative teaching approaches, have further empowered our staff to stay at the forefront of education.

We are also proud of the international exposure our students have gained through the CCKSS Global Connect programme. Overseas experiences in countries such as China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam have broadened their perspectives, deepened their understanding of Singapore's place in the global context, and strengthened their commitment to the nation.

Our achievements as a school would not have been possible without the meaningful partnerships between teachers, parents, and the wider community. The African proverb, “It takes a village to raise a child,” aptly describes the spirit of our collaborative efforts. Parents, the School Advisory Committee, alumni, and community partners have been invaluable in supporting our students' holistic development through shared goals, open communication, and active involvement.

As we look forward to 2025, let us build on the strong foundation we have laid together. To all CCKSians, parents, and school partners, let us strive for even greater achievements in the years ahead, united in our commitment to providing the best for our students.

Together We Excel!
