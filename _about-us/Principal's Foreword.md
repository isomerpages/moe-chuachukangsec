2023 is a special year for Chua Chu Kang Secondary School as we begin the new journey as a merged school – merger of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School and Teck Whye Secondary School. I am absolutely honoured by the appointment as Principal to Chua Chu Kang Secondary School wef 15 December 2022.

To briefly introduce myself; I have been in the education service since 1997. I was Head of Department for ICT in Siglap Secondary School and Admiralty Secondary School before moving to MOE HQ to take up the portfolio of an Educational Technology Officer for two years. I then assumed the role of Vice-Principal in Beatty Secondary School as well as Unity Secondary School from 2006 to 2010. After which, I was appointed Principal of two Secondary Schools – Canberra Secondary School from 2011 to 2016 and Bukit Merah Secondary School from 2017 to 2022. I hope that my experiences in the last six schools and MOE HQ will help me in guiding and enriching the teachers and students of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School

The merged school is the combination of two good schools of long history with many good practices and achievements. The coming together of these two good schools will only make us stronger and allow us to ensure that our students will benefit from a wide range of educational programmes, CCAs; and enjoy up-to-date facilities.

The preparation of the merger journey started as early as April 2022 when I was first appointed as Principal-designate of the merged school. I am blessed with a team of committed key personnel who worked tirelessly to prepare for the start of the merged school. 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mdm Adel Ong, ex-Principal of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School and Mr N Sivarajan, ex-Principal of Teck Whye Secondary School for their invaluable support & advice given to me as I went through the preparation in 2022 to start the merger school.

The theme for 2023 is “Together A New Beginning”. It is an apt theme, which signifies the aspiration of the students, staff, parents and school partners of the two schools coming together to give our BEST so that the new merged school can ride on the many great achievements that both schools have made over the past years and to do even better in the years ahead.

The journey to prepare for the merged school and the start of the new academic year 2023 as a merged school was an exciting one with students, staff and school achieving many significant achievements such as the completion of the whole staff room renovations in 2022, Sec 2 Combined Camp in 2022 and the Start Right Programme, week-long school-wide orientation programme, and Chinese New Year Celebrations with mass lohei session for the whole school in Jan 2023.

In Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, in all we do, students will always at the centre of our consideration and that staff are key in helping the school to achieve our school objectives. Our SAC, Parents, Alumni and our community play an important role in supporting the school to provide a holistic education for our students.
 
With the good foundation laid down by my predecessors and with the continued strong support from our staff and partners, I am confident that Chua Chu Kang Secondary School will be able to rise up to meet the challenges of the future and scale greater heights.

CCKSians, Parents & School Partners, let’s continue to work together to give our Best so that the school can ride on the many great achievements we have made over the years and to do even better in the years ahead.

Together A New Beginning
