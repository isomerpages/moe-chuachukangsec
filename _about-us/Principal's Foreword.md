Welcome to Chua Chu Kang Secondary School!

As we embark on a new year in 2024, I am filled with gratitude and excitement for what lies ahead. 2023 was a monumental year for us as we embraced a new beginning with the merger of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School and Teck Whye Secondary School. Our theme, "Together A New Beginning," aptly captured the spirit of unity and collaboration that defined our journey.

Building on this foundation, our theme for 2024 is "Stronger Together." This theme reflects our commitment to harnessing the strength of our combined talents, resources, and experiences to create a supportive and dynamic learning environment for our students. 

The merger brought together two schools with rich histories and numerous achievements. The amalgamation of these strengths has enriched our educational programs, co-curricular activities, and facilities, offering our students a broader and more robust platform for growth and success.

I am incredibly proud of the dedication and hard work displayed by our students, staff, parents, and school partners throughout this transition. The success of our StartRight Programme, which facilitated goal-setting, discipline, and teamwork, is a testament to the resilience and positive spirit of our school community. The program laid the groundwork for strong teacher-student relationships and a conducive learning atmosphere.

Our achievements in 2023 were numerous and commendable. Our Performing Arts Groups excelled in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, our B Girls Hockey team secured a top position in the National B Division tournament, and our Uniformed Groups attained prestigious awards. These accomplishments reflect our students' talent, determination, and hard work, supported by our dedicated staff.

A significant milestone was the establishment of our new School Vision, Mission, and Values (VMV). These guiding principles were crafted with input from staff, parents, and the School Advisory Committee, ensuring a shared vision for our future.

**VISION** 
<br>CCKSians with Future-Ready Mindsets and Empathetic Hearts who Act Responsibly.

**MISSION**
<br>A Positive Environment that Empowers CCKSians to Thrive and Contribute.

**VALUES**
<br>Respect, Resilience, Integrity, Care, Enterprise.

Our School Vision emphasizes the importance of preparing our students for future challenges while nurturing their empathy and responsibility. Our Mission underscores our commitment to creating an inclusive, empowering educational environment that equips students to thrive and make a positive impact on society. Through our Values, we aim to cultivate well-rounded individuals who excel academically and possess strong character and social responsibility.

One of our proudest moments was the co-creation of our new School Song. This collaborative project involved teachers and students working together to create a song that embodies the heritage and aspirations of our merged school. I extend my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Anthony Chua, Ms. Jo-anne Tan, Mdm Fiona Tay, and Mr. Melvin Chan for their dedication and creativity in bringing this project to life.

At Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, our students are at the heart of all we do. Our staff, parents, alumni, and community partners play vital roles in supporting our mission to provide a holistic education. With the strong foundation laid by our predecessors and the continued support from our school community, I am confident that we will rise to meet future challenges and achieve greater heights together.

CCKSians, Parents, and School Partners, let us continue to work together, stronger than ever, to build on our achievements and create an even brighter future for our school.

Stronger Together!
