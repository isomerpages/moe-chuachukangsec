<h3><strong>பாரம்பரிய கலைகள் பற்றி அறிந்துகொண்ட மாணவர்கள்</strong></h3>
<p>Our Secondary 1 students' Tamil Learning Journey found our fledgling CCKSians
in Little India. Our CCKSians actively participated in Tamil cultural activities
and engaged in hands-on experiences such as playing traditional music and
performing Indian dance. This immersive approach helps foster a deeper
understanding and appreciation of Tamil culture. Their learning journey
was so fascinating that their activities were featured in Tamil Murasu
newspaper on 20 January 2025! The article featured insightful interviews
with our teachers, Mdm. Mohanavalli and Mdm. Chitra Murugan, who emphasized
the importance of experiential learning and highlighted how the event helps
students learn about culture beyond the classroom as well as enhance their
speaking and writing skills.</p>

<h3><strong>2年转快捷源流女生朝梦想前进</strong></h3>
<p>We are very proud of our CCKSian Charlene Cham (4A'23), who received her
O Level results today. Charlene embodies the values of resilience. Beginning
Sec 1 in the Normal Technical stream, Charlene felt that she preferred
to pursue the JC pathway after secondary school and decided to work towards
this goal. Her hard work paid off, and she was laterally transferred to
Sec 2NA and later on to Sec 3Exp. What is more commendable is how she managed
to balance her commitments in Student Council as well as Hockey and still
work in her academic pursuits. Charlene is an inspiration to all CCKSians
as she embodies the resilient spirit to stay true to pursue her goals and
achieve them.</p>
