<h1><strong>In the News</strong></h1><h3><strong>2年转快捷源流女生朝梦想前进</strong></h3><p>We are very proud of our CCKSian Charlene Cham (4A'23), who received her O Level results today. Charlene embodies the values of resilience. Beginning Sec 1 in the Normal Technical stream, Charlene felt that she preferred to pursue the JC pathway after secondary school and decided to work towards this goal. Her hard work paid off, and she was laterally transferred to Sec 2NA and later on to Sec 3Exp. What is more commendable is how she managed to balance her commitments in Student Council as well as Hockey and still work in her academic pursuits. Charlene is an inspiration to all CCKSians as she embodies the resilient spirit to stay true to pursue her goals and achieve them.</p><p>Published on Shin Min Daily News, 10 January 2024</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/About Us/In The News/2_____________.jpeg"></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>'The ideas never stop coming until the bell rings’: How one teacher makes History this riveting</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/About%20Us/In%20The%20News/mr-melvin-chan_2.jpg"></div><p>Mr Melvin Chan Joo Seng, Senior Teacher (History) at Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, is an ardent practitioner of the Knowledge Building technique, which taps on the power of collectives to co-create knowledge.
