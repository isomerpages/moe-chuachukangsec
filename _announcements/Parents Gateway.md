Chua Chu Kang Secondary School is pleased to inform all parents that our school will be onboarding Parents Gateway from Term 3,2019 onwards.Â  Parents Gateway is a mobile app specially designed for parents. Developed by MOE and GovTech, the app allows parents to engage with school, receive information and perform a range of administrative functions such as giving consent for school trips.  
  
We would like to invite parents to download the Parents Gateway mobile app on your mobile phone (via on iOS and Android) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process by 30 June 2019.
