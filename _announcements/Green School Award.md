# **Green School Award**

CCKSS’ green efforts are spearheaded by the Environmental Science Club (formerly known as Green Club). Each year, members of the Environmental Science Club keep up with environmental issues and promote good environmental habits among friends, family members and the Choa Chu Kang community. 

Some of their efforts included upcycling unwanted materials in the 3R’s Waste to Gems programme, encouraging their friends to clean the tables after meals, sharing the Mozzie Wipeout with their family members and designing posters to encourage Clean, Dry & Sparkling Toilets.

Chen Jia Yi of Sec 2/5 said the 3R’s Waste to Gems programme taught her how even ‘waste’ materials could be remade into “cool products”. In her opinion, most products, “with proper designing and enough effort, can look brand new”.

Take a look at how students turn old t-shirts into useful coasters.
