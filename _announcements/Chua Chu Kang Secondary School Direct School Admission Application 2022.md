Information on 2022 Direct School Admission to Chua Chu Kang Secondary School   

(For admission to Secondary One in 2023)


### Introduction

The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004. It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school.

When choosing a secondary school, parents are encouraged to consider the students’ aptitudes and strengths, the school’s academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the students’ talents.

We would like to invite students with an interest or aptitude in the talent areas stated below and seeking admission to our school, to apply through this exercise.
