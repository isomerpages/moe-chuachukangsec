The mission of Netball is to nurture the character and leadership skills of our girls. There is a strong emphasis on resilience, teamwork and communication within the team through regular netball training and strategy planning sessions. Netball students train as a united team with strong emphasis on teamwork and communication.   

Students are given opportunities to maximise their potential as a player and leader. Both ‘B’ & ‘C’ teams compete in the West Zone Inter-School Netball Championships annually. This year, they participated in friendly matches with other schools, such as Bukit Panjang Government High School, Juying Secondary School, River Valley High School, West Spring Secondary School and Hua Hi School. The ‘C’ Division teams were able to put their skills to the test on court during a carnival held at Kallang Netball Centre. The seniors were also given opportunities to develop their leadership capabilities by leading their juniors in physical training sessions as well as court drills.  

Such activities give the girls great exposure to competitions, and strengthen them mentally and physically for their West Zone Inter-School Games. Students are also exposed to Values-in-Action (VIA) activities such as organising and conducting a Netball clinic for the Girl Guides. 

Students learnt that coaching is definitely not easy. They had to plan and draw up their own schedules, complete every planned item within the time given, and learn to hone their communication skills too as they helped their peers in the Girl Guides learn the basics of Netball.  

Netball is a sport that pushes the girls beyond their perceived capabilities. It challenges both their mental strength and physical strength as they continuously seek to improve.
