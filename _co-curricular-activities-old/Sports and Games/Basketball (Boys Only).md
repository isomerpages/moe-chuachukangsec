The aims of the Basketball team are to nurture responsible leaders, instill the value of hard work and commitment, and develop sports talent through rigorous training, friendly competitions with other schools, and divisional tournaments organised by the Singapore Schools Sports Council (SSSC).

The highlights of 2019 included participation in the West Zone Inter-School Basketball Tournament and a Values-in-Action (VIA) collaboration with the InfoComm Club conducted by our members, with guidance from the teachers and the coach.


For both the ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division tournaments, the students managed to win a few games and taste some success. Despite not making it past the first round of the tournament, the boys learnt valuable lessons, and the experience that they have accumulated would serve them well in future tournaments. They have set higher goals for their 2020 tournaments and are working towards achieving them.

As for the VIA collaboration with another CCA group, members of the Basketball team worked well together to conduct a meaningful learning experience for their peers in the InfoComm Club. They taught students in the InfoComm Club the fundamentals of basketball.&nbsp;

Our boys also honed their planning skills by organising and officiating games.&nbsp;
