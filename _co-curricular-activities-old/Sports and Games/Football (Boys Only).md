'Quality Football with Quality Education.’ That is the motto of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School football team.&nbsp;  


The CCA programme gives members a chance to develop their skills on field and off. The programmes consists of rigorous training activities that not only build members’ physical abilities to play football, but also build their character and mental strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Students learn the basic skills in Secondary 1 and progressively increase their level of competencies throughout their years in the school.&nbsp; This development focuses on the holistic development of the players rather than simply their physical attributes. Students learn to work as a team, rather than as individuals. 

One of the strongest traits developed in students is self-discipline. Students become more focused not only on the field, but also more focused when it comes to their studies. Regular feedback between the teachers-in-charge and Subject Teachers ensure that the students’ studies are not neglected. Teachers schedule review sessions with players to understand how they can be helped to achieve more and processes are reviewed termly for the players’ benefit.&nbsp;

2019 saw a change in the competition format for both divisions. Teams no longer compete at the zone level, but at the national level. As such, we got to pit ourselves against better and stronger teams.&nbsp;

In the first year of the new competition format, our C division team got to the 2nd round of the League 4 competition, while our B division team came in 4th in the League 2 competition.
