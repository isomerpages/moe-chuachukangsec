CCKSS' Condor Sea Scout Group endeavours to holistically nurture boys across seven themes in accordance with Singapore Scout Association’s (SSA) Revised Scheme, namely (1) Citizenship &amp; Global Awareness, (2) Leadership &amp; Interests, (3) Adventure &amp; Outdoor, (4) Service &amp; the Community, (5) Sports &amp; Physical Recreation, (6) Inspirations, Beliefs &amp; Attitudes and (7) Creative Pursuits.

Guided by the Scout Promise &amp; Law, 21st Century Competencies and school values, Scouts journey through the various tiers - Scout (Tier 1), Discoverer (Tier 2), Explorer (Tier 3), Voyager (Tier 4), Chief Commissioner’s Award (SSA’s pinnacle award for Scouts) in their four years with Condor Sea Scouts.&nbsp;

Boys learn basic Scoutcraft plus a myriad of useful knowledge &amp; skills (e.g. seamanship, core scouting experiences, swimming, lifesaving, first aid etc.) and attributes (e.g. sense of community, service, leadership etc.) during weekly CCA sessions.

Annual milestone activities include swimming and lifesaving lessons, Job Week, Troop Expedition (2-Day, 1-Night land hike cum kayaking), kayaking, selling of Donation Draw tickets and Annual Camp. 

We are proud to say that CCKSS has clinched the Frank Cooper Sands Gold Award (FCSA) for the ninth year running.


Condor Alumni (CCKSS graduates) actively return to serve the school while continuing to grow in the Condor Venture Scout and Rover Scout Units. Alumni (Ventures and Rovers) assist teachers and senior Volunteer Adult Leaders in training current students while they work towards the President's Scout Award and Baden Powell Award.&nbsp;
  

Condor Ventures also conduct annual Wilderness Survival Courses (advanced outdoor skills) for graduating UG student leaders. The training and service have resulted in the Venture Unit and Rover Unit being awarded the FCSA Gold and Bronze Awards respectively.
