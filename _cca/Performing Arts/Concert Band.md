**About us**

The concert band is one of the Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) CCA in the school. The objective of the concert band is to provide opportunities for students to develop a lifelong passion for the arts. Through the activities and events during CCA, students will develop 21st Century Competencies, social emotional competencies and values. 
 
Chua Chu Kang Secondary Concert Band aims to provide a platform for like-minded individuals to make music together and establish lifelong friendships. Students attend music theory lessons and learn a musical instrument from our dedicated music instructor, Mr Kenneth Lun.
