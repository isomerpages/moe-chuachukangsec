The Modern Dance Club specialises in Contemporary Dance and aims to nurture a pool of talented and passionate dancers in CCKSS. Through the clubâ€™s comprehensive dance education programme, students not only pick up dance techniques and build up strength and flexibility, they also gain a strong appreciation for the arts, develop tenacity and resilience, and become confident in achieving their personal and dance goals. Besides taking part in the bi-annual Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging, the dancers also perform for school events such as the annual Speech Day.
