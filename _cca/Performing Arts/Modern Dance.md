<p><strong>About us</strong>
</p>
<p>CCKSians Dance is one of the most vibrant CCAs offered in Chua Chu Kang
Secondary School, with a line-up of performances each year for a diversity
of events. It is an intrinsic part of the school’s cultural scene, allowing
CCKSians s to experience first-hand the beauty and intricacy of dance,
and the art of expression that underlies.</p>
<p>We aspire to groom and bring out the best in each student in performing
arts. Our members are exposed to different genres of dance like Contemporary
and Hip hop. They are involved in discussing and relating to the values
of the respective art forms and how these art forms apply in their lives
and societies across cultures. As part of confidence building, the dancers
also apply the skills, techniques, and processes in the creation of their
dances, while showcasing their skills through dance presentation and performances
to different types of audiences.</p>
<p>CCKSians Dance livens up the atmosphere at many events such as Chinese
New Year Celebrations, Hari Raya Celebrations, Teacher’s Day, Open House,
and many more. We also took part in many external events such as SYF Celebrations
festival concert and various community events, offering its members various
experiences and opportunities.</p>
<p>This is where dancers learn, grow and excel as one troop building perseverance
and unity in line with the school values. Our members are a team of driven,
passionate, and talented individuals who share a love for dance. They strive
for the best in all their performances and dedicate much time and effort
to the CCA. In time to come, we hope to become a niche area in performing
arts for Chua Chu Kang Secondary School.</p>
