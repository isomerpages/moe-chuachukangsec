**About us**

CCKSians Dance is one of the most vibrant CCAs offered in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, with a line-up of performances each year for a diversity of events. It is an intrinsic part of the school's cultural scene, allowing CCKSians s to experience first-hand the beauty and intricacy of dance, and the art of expression that underlies.

We aspire to groom and bring out the best in each student in performing arts. Our members are exposed to different genres of dance like Contemporary and Hip hop. They are involved in discussing and relating to the values of the respective art forms and how these art forms apply in their lives and societies across cultures. As part of confidence building, the dancers also apply the skills, techniques, and processes in the creation of their dances, while showcasing their skills through dance presentation and performances to different types of audiences.

CCKSians Dance livens up the atmosphere at many events such as Chinese New Year Celebrations, Hari Raya Celebrations, Teacher’s Day, Open House, and many more. We also took part in many external events such as SYF Celebrations festival concert and various community events, offering its members various experiences and opportunities.

This is where dancers learn, grow and excel as one troop building perseverance and unity in line with the school values. Our members are a team of driven, passionate, and talented individuals who share a love for dance. They strive for the best in all their performances and dedicate much time and effort to the CCA. In time to come, we hope to become a niche area in performing arts for Chua Chu Kang Secondary School.
