**About us**

Guitar Ensemble was formed in 2011 with less than 15 members. We took part in our first ever Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) in April 2011. Since then, our ensemble has grown in number and are highly motivated and ambitious to be a proficient and respectable music community. 

Chua Chu Kang Guitar Ensemble aims to provide our students an experience in learning a variety of performing styles and provide an enriching learning journey in music and guitar-playing skills. Through the activities and events in our CCA, we hope to provide a platform for students to establish lasting friendships and make music together with like-minded peers.
