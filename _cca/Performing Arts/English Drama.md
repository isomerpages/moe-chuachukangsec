The Drama Club provides a platform for students to explore not only their talents and abilities in theatre, but to also grow their empathy. Students are nurtured to be compassionate leaders who are ready to step up and think on their feet in challenging situations. Through the various opportunities given to them, Drama Club members demonstrate strong resilience and adaptability in how they approach problems, becoming the capable young leaders they are today.
