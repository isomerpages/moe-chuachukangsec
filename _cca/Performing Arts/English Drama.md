**About us**

The English Drama is one of the Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) CCA in the school. The objective of the English Drama is to provide opportunities for students to develop a lifelong passion for the arts. Through the activities and events during CCA, students will develop 21st Century Competencies, social emotional competencies and values. 
 
Chua Chu Kang Secondary Concert Band aims to provide a platform for like-minded individuals to make music together and establish lifelong friendships. Students attend theatre production theory lessons and learn characterisation from our dedicated drama instructor, Mr Fadhil.
