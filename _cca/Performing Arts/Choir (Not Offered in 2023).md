The Chua Chu Kang Secondary School Choir sings and performs songs of a variety of genres, formats and languages.

In 2019, the Choir performed in the Voices for Singapore Festival at CHIJMES which was open to the public. We also achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment for the 2019 Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. 

The Choir prides itself on being a community of students and teachers who are dedicated. The Choir performs at the school’s Speech Day. In addition, the Choir supports annual school events such as the Chinese New Year celebration and the Performing Arts showcase.

The Choir also reaches out to various segments of society. This year, Choir members interacted and performed for the children from PCF Childcare Centre.  In addition, the Choir was also invited to perform at the Choa Chu Kang and Keat Hong PassionArts Festival Village held at Keat Hong Community Club.

* Choir Leaders’ Training
