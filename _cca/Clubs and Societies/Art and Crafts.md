In the Arts and Crafts Club, we strongly believe art is an avenue to express ourselves and unleash our creativity. Therefore, members let their imagination run wild and hone their artistic skills on different art media such as digital art, watercolour, clay sculpting and others. Under the assistance of teachers and senior members, every member is able to produce his or her best pieces of art.
