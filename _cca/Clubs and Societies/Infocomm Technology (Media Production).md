**About us**

The Infocomm Technology (Media Production) Club is a safe haven for avid fans of photography, events set up and life-long learners of lifeskills! Based on learner-centred activities, the club seeks to upskill our members and to provide them with platforms to shine and serve. We are the sentinels overlooking key events in Chua Chu Kang Secondary, the stalwart stewards of running Chinese New Year, Pongal and even Academic celebrations smoothly. Need sound set-up? Projector support? Artistically-framed photographs? The Infocomm Technology (Media Production) Club members are ready!
