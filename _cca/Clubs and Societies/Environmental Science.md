**About us**

The objectives of the Environmental Science Club are:
1. to develop members’ self-awareness and help them acquire life skills to enrich their well-being
2. to develop members’ sense of belonging to the club through peer interaction and peer support
3. to instil in members a sense of responsibility towards the environment
 

Our mission statement for the Environmental Science Club is “Nurturing through Nature”.  In the Environmental Science Club, students are given opportunities to explore, to create and innovate, and to do their part to save the Earth.

Environmental Science Club members manage and maintain the Herb and Spice Garden in school.  They are responsible for watering the plants, weeding, and planting new seeds. In 2021, the Herb and Spice Garden attained the Gold award in the Community in Bloom (CIB) competition. We also achieved the Outstanding Educational Community Garden Award. In 2023, the members have started to grow rice in mud ponds as part of their Sustainability Programme.

Environmental Science Club members went to Siloso Beach Resort, Marina Barrage, Sungei Buloh, Hort Park and Choa Chu Kang Park for learning journeys. Through these experiences, members learnt about new plants such as their characteristics and benefits.  They also learnt new gardening skills and techniques such as creating a compost bed and growing new plants by stem cutting. 

Environmental Science Club has achieved 3 stars accreditation and 2 stars accreditation under the Green Schools @ South West CDC in 2021 and 2022 respectively.  This award recognises members’ efforts and contributions to save the Earth. For example, members actively raise awareness about the Mozzie Wipeout campaign among residents living in the neighbourhood. In addition, they encourage their peers and members of the public to play an active role in protecting the environment.

Environmental Science Club members are given opportunities to attend Do-It-Yourself workshops on how recyclable items can be upcycled into useful items. This year, they learnt how to make mask holders by using milk cartons. Members also collaborate with NParks for the Community in Nature Programme for schools. This programme promotes awareness about biodiversity in Singapore.
