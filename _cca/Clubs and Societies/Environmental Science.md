<p><strong>About Us</strong>
</p>
<p>The objectives of the Environmental Science Club are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to develop members’ self-awareness and help them acquire life skills to
enrich their well-being</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to develop members’ sense of belonging to the club through peer interaction
and peer support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to instil in members a sense of responsibility towards the environment</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our mission statement for the Environmental Science Club is “Nurturing
through Nature”. In the Environmental Science Club, students are given
opportunities to explore, to create and innovate, and to do their part
to save the Earth.</p>
<p>Environmental Science Club members manage and maintain the green spaces
in school. They are responsible for watering the plants, weeding, and planting
new seeds. In recognition of their efforts, the Herb and Spice Garden attained
the Gold Award in the Community in Bloom (CIB) competition and the Outstanding
Educational Community Garden Award in 2021. In 2023, the members expanded
their Sustainability Programme by growing rice in mud ponds, further demonstrating
their commitment to environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>Environmental Science Club members also went on learning journeys to Siloso
Beach Resort, Marina Barrage, Sungei Buloh, Hort Park and Choa Chu Kang
Park. Through these experiences, members learnt about new plants, their
characteristics and benefits. They also picked up new gardening skills
and techniques such as creating a compost bed and growing new plants by
stem cutting. Their continuous learning and application of these skills
have contributed to the club’s success in achieving 2 Stars accreditation
under the Green Schools @ South West CDC in 2022, and 3 Stars accreditation
since 2023 and 2024.</p>
<p>This award recognises members’ efforts and contributions to save the Earth.
For example, members actively raise awareness about the Mozzie Wipeout
campaign among residents living in the neighbourhood. In addition, they
encourage their peers and members of the public to play an active role
in protecting the environment. Their consistent dedication also earned
them the Sustainability Advocacy Challenge (SAC) Silver Award and the Community
in Nature (CIN) Merit Award in 2024.</p>
<p>Environmental Science Club members are also given opportunities to learn
about sustainability, where they explore concepts such as solar power and
solar energy by building solar cars, and learn about the importance of
green spaces. They also create prototypes to develop their understanding
of how green spaces contribute to a sustainable environment.</p>
<p>This year, they learnt how to make mask holders by using milk cartons.
Members have also collaborated with NParks for the Community in Nature
Programme, which promotes awareness about biodiversity in Singapore. Their
active participation in biodiversity initiatives was recognised when the
club received the Nature Society of Singapore Biodiversity Race 2023 Most
Unique Observation Award (Spotted Owl) and the National Youth Upcycling
Movement (NYUM) Bronze Award. In addition, members achieved 2nd Place for
the Most Improved category in the <em>Every Singaporean a Naturalist</em> programme
by the Nature Society (Singapore) in 2023, and several students received
Novice Naturalist Certificates of Achievement for their enthusiasm and
contributions.</p>
