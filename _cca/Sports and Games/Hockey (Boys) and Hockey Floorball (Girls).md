### Hockey (Boys)
The CCKSS Hockey and Floorball Team has come a long way since it began in the early 2000s. Over the years, both the Girls’ and Boys’ teams have participated in numerous competitions and have clinched several titles in the National Schools Tournaments.

As testament to their skills, many hockey players have been selected to join the National Men and Womens’ Hockey Teams and have represented Singapore in several regional and international competitions.

All these achievements have been made possible by a team of dedicated teachers who work hard to uphold the high standards of hockey and sportsmanship in the team. In addition to normal training sessions, the players’ skills are also honed through exposure to inter-school and overseas friendlies.

### Hockey/Floorball (Girls)
The CCKSS Floorball team is made up of female students who possess sportsmanship and resilience, and strive to do their best. The team works hard to improve themselves every year for their annual competitions. The upcoming merger between Chua Chu Kang Secondary School and Teck Whye Secondary School allows the ‘C’ Division girls to have joint training sessions at the Teck Whye Secondary School compound and make new friends. The new teams will continue to work hard in future competitions.
