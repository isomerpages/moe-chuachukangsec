**About us**

Floorball is one of the fastest growing sports across the globe. It is a fun and fast-paced game that is as enjoyable as it is tiring. The floorball team is made up of a team of girls who possess sportsmanship, resilience and strives to do their best in everything they do.

During the competition seasons, the girls juggle between their studies and their extra trainings. Despite that, the girls never complain, instead they work harder because of their passion for floorball.  A lot of sweat, effort, and time are poured into training even after the team has finished their zonal competition. 

The girls are not only confined to floorball but in fact utilise the opportunity of VIA to develop empathy and the capacity to serve others.
