**About us**

Wushu is derived from traditional Chinese martial art practices which blend with elements of performance. 

Students learn the basic Wushu steps, and the training difficulty progressively increases through the year. Wushu students strive to improve their physical abilities and mental strength. Opportunities are provided for potential students to take up leadership roles to develop them holistically. 

Once they have built confidence and competence in their skills, they have opportunities to represent CCKSS in national competitions.
