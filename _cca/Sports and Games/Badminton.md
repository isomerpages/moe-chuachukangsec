Badminton is all about passion for the sport. Most students who join the club have little or no prior experience. Nevertheless, every year, our members train rigorously to participate in the National School Games and other competitions. Inter-class competitions are chances for our members to contribute to school-wide events and annual camps are opportunities for them to form new and deeper friendships. We instill discipline in and foster camaraderie among our students. They not only learn a sport, but also pick up valuable life skills.
