At CCKSS Football, we aim to instill core values in our young players so they become better individuals who will serve the community as well as contribute to the sporting fraternity. Our dedicated teachers, together with our vastly experienced coach, work hand-in-hand to develop a training programme designed to help our young players fulfil their potential. By the time they ‘graduate’, they are players with a set of skills and abilities that will enhance their lifelong pursuit of a beautiful game.
