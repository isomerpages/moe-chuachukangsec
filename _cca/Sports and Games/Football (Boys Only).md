**About us**

At CCKS Football, we aim to instil core values in our young players in the hope that they become better individuals who will serve the community as well as contribute back to the sporting fraternity.

Our dedicated teachers, together with our vastly experienced coach, work hand-in-hand to develop a training program designed to help our young players to fulfil their potential. By the time they have completed their education with us, we would have developed our students into better players with a set of skills and abilities that will enhance their lifelong pursuit of the beautiful game.

This year, with the merger of 2 schools, we had a bigger talent pool to choose from.  Through our participation in the National Schools Games, (NSG) our boys were able to forge a stronger friendship and bonds amongst themselves. 

With a shared sense of value and identity, we look forward to creating a stronger team to be able to challenge at the higher levels of the NSG so that our students can gain invaluable experience and further developed their knowledge of the game.
