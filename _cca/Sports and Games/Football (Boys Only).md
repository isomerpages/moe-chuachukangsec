<p><strong>About us</strong>
</p>
<p>At CCKS Football, we aim to instil core values in our young players in
the hope that they become better individuals who will serve the community
as well as contribute back to the sporting fraternity.</p>
<p>Our dedicated teachers, together with our vastly experienced coach, work
together to develop a training program designed to help our young players
to fulfil their potential. By the time they have completed their education
with us, we would have developed our students into better players with
a set of skills and abilities that will enhance their lifelong pursuit
of the beautiful game.</p>
<p>Through our participation in the National Schools Games, (NSG) our boys
were able to forge a stronger friendship and bonds amongst themselves.
With a shared sense of value and identity, we look forward to creating
a stronger team to be able to challenge at the higher levels of the NSG
so that our students can gain invaluable experience and further developed
their knowledge of the game.</p>
