Taekwondo aims to develop strength, speed, flexibility and stamina in our students through kicking and self-defense techniques. Through the influence of ethical self-conduct, the CCA aims to instill the importance of self-responsibility in our students, developing them into a confident individual who is able to work effectively in teams, take initiative and constantly strive towards excellence.
