**About us**

Taekwondo is a martial art which develops strength, speed, flexibility, and stamina in our students through kicking and self-defence techniques. 

Through the influence of ethical self-conduct, we aim to instil the importance of self-responsibility in our students, developing them into a confident individual who can work effectively in teams, take initiatives, and constantly strives for excellence.  

Students will get the opportunity to participate in matches and competitions allowing them to apply the skills they have learnt in a competitive environment.
