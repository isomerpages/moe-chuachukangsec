CCKSS Swimming Club is the only water sport in the school. The club aims to nurture and instill in its members values of excellence, confidence, teamwork, discipline and sportsmanship. 

Members learn the four competitive strokes from trained, experienced coaches, and are given opportunities to exchange pointers with various professional swim teams in Singapore.

This year, students participated in competitions such as the Inter-Schools Swimming Championships, the ActiveSG, 27th Super Sprint Series and 3rd Madwave Swim Challenge 2019. 

Other than competitions, students engaged in Values-in-Action activities, to volunteer their time and services. These activities take the form of helping to do timekeeping in swimming events held by various organisations.
