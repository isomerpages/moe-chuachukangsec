NPCC works closely with the Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe. We nurture our cadets holistically through many enriching courses and events. Secondary Two cadets attend the Community Emergency Preparedness Programme (CEPP) at Bukit Batok Fire Station to learn lifesaving skills and essential emergency procedures. They attain the Civil Defence Badge at the end of the course. Secondary Three cadets have the opportunity to attend the Classification Shoot at Home Team Academyâ€™s shooting range and participate in competitions like the anti-job scam poster competition by the Choa Chu Kang Neighbourhood Police Centre.
