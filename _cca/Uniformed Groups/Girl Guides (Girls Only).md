**About us**

Guiding in CCKSS provides a safe environment for students to explore new possibilities and achieve personal goals while making friends and having adventures. Girl Guides offer a wide array of activities which aim to develop the girls to their fullest potential and inculcate in them, values such as team spirit, perseverance, responsibility, and integrity. 

The motto of Girl Guides is ‘Be Prepared’. This is the mantra that helps to shape our Guides in everything that they do. From making difficult decisions to handling new situations, our Guides are trained to face challenges confidently. The girls work together in Patrols and learn new skills through badge attainment. Our Guides plan their own activities that help to uncover new talents and learn practical skills that will enrich their lives.
