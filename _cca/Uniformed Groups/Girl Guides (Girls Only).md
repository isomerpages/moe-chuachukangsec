The motto of Girl Guides is ‘Be Prepared’. This is the mantra that helps to shape our Guides in everything that they do. From making difficult decisions to handling new situations, our Guides are trained to face challenges confidently. Guides have the opportunity to learn new skills through badge attainment. Apart from meeting the requirements of the Guiding programme, our Guides take the initiative to plan activities that help to uncover new talents and learn practical skills that will enrich their lives. The Guides are actively involved in HQ-organised annual events like the West Division Campfire and the West Division Day.
