**About us**

The CCKSS Condor Sea Scout Group endeavours to holistically nurture boys across seven themes, namely, Citizenship &amp; Global Awareness, Leadership &amp; Interests, Adventure &amp; Outdoor, Service &amp; the Community, Sports &amp; Physical Recreation, Inspirations, Beliefs &amp; Attitudes and Creative Pursuits. Guided by the Scout Promise and Law, Scouts journey through four tiers, Scout, Discoverer, Explorer and Voyager before attaining the Chief Commissionerâ€™s Award. Our unit activities include Land and Kayaking Expedition, Annual Camp, Job Week and external courses such as swimming/lifesaving and First Aid.
