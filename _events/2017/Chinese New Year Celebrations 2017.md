# **Chinese New Year Celebrations 2017**

On 27 of January, CCKSians started off the Chinese New Year holiday with a bang as celebrations for the festival came underway with vibrant performances put up by students in Chinese Orchestra, Wushu, and Choir, as well as Secondary 4 students who went for the Xiâ€™an internationalisation trip. This year, our celebration was blessed by two teachers dressed as the Gods of Fortune, bringing us luck in the form of candies. There was also an exciting game segment with the House Masters and House Captains enthusiastically pitting themselves against each other. Gong Xi Fa Cai, Chua Chu Kang Secondary School!
