# **Values-in-Action (ViA)**

Values-in-Action (ViA) is a key platform for nurturing our  CCKSians' character and to help them imbibe the school value of 'Putting Others Before Self'. The ViA programme is a multi-tiered one, including school-wide ViA, ViA carried out by CCA and classes, and student-initiated ViA.

### School Wide ViA

Staff and students embarked on a school-wide Values in Action (VIA) activity which was held on 25 March, from 8am to 12pm. During the event, everyone worked together to collect old clothing and newspapers from the neighbourhood of Teck Whye and Choa Chu Kang. This year, parents were also invited to join their children in this meaningful activity. The event was a great success, bringing to fore the school’s value of ‘Putting Others Before Self’.
