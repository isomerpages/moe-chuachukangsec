### FAQ MTL Matters

#### SECTION 1: SECOND LANGUAGE

Under MOE’s bilingual policy, all students must offer English and an official MTL. 

Learning difficulty in MTL is not a valid reason to apply for MTL exemption. MTL exemption should only be considered as a last resort for students under exceptional circumstances as highlighted below:

**a) Mid-stream Entry**

The student enters our school system mid-stream after prolonged absence from our school system and with no or weak prior learning of any of our MTLs or languages that can be offered as MTL-in-lieu. Applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and several factors will be taken into consideration holistically, including:

a. Duration and location(s) of the student’s stay overseas   
b. Prior language learning   
c. MTL curriculum and assessment demands 

**b) Special Educational Needs**

The student has certified Special Educational Needs (SEN) and shows severe difficulty in coping with his overall learning.

If you would like to apply for MTL exemption based on Point a) or b) above, please leave a message in the question segment of the registration form for our Head of Department for MTL to get in touch with you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### SECTION 2: THIRD LANGUAGE – MALAY (SPECIAL PROGRAMME), CHINESE (SPECIAL PROGRAMME), ARABIC & BAHASA INDONESIA

You will be informed of the results of your child’s application to offer a 3rd language via Parents Gateway. If your child’s application is unsuccessful, he/she may consider signing up for Conversational Chinese (for non-Chinese) or Conversational Malay (for non-Malay) offered by our school if he/she is keen to learn the Chinese or Malay language.

The courses will be conducted in Terms 2 and 3. More details will be announced later.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### NON-TAMIL INDIAN LANGAUGES (NTIL)

Students who have obtained approval to study Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi or Urdu at the primary level are not required to re-apply. They are required to continue to study the approved NTIL at secondary and pre-university levels.

For 2021, CCKSS will continue to host Hindi lessons for our Sec 2 to 4 students, where a Hindi teacher from DAV Hindi School will come to the school to provide Hindi instruction during curriculum time. For Sec 1 level, whether we are able to host Hindi lessons in school depends on the number of Sec 1 Hindi students posted to us, and the decision by parents.

If you would like to explore the possibility of having Hindi lessons for your child in our school during curriculum time, please leave a message in the question segment of the registration form for our Subject Head/Malay Language and Tamil Language to get in touch with you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### MTL-IN-LIEU (ASIAN LANGUAGES/FOREIGN LANGUAGES)

If your child’s approved MTL in-lieu at primary level was an Asian Language (AsL) / Foreign Language (FL), he/she must continue to study the subject at the secondary level.

You are not required to submit a re-application if your child has obtained approval at the primary level to offer AsL/FL.

You would have been informed of the implications of offering AsL/FL as MTL-in-lieu before the submission of application in primary school:
* Students are required to learn the AsL/FL privately at the primary, secondary and pre-university levels, as instruction is not provided by MOE.
* Students are required to provide documentation (e.g. marked assignment, result slip, payment receipt) to the school to show that they are learning AsL/FL regularly.
* Students are required to take the AsL/FL papers at the GCE ‘O’ Level and the Arabic or FL papers at the GCE A-Level (H1) examinations.
* Students are required to fulfil the MTL requirement by attaining the minimum AsL/FL grade for admission into a junior college or centralised institute (D7 or above for GCE ‘O’ Level), or a local publicly-funded undergraduate programme (S grade or above for GCE ‘A’ Level H1).
