### FAQ Subject Based Banding (NT/NA students)

Sec 1 students posted to the N(A) and N(T) courses may be offered EL/ Math/ Science/ MTL at a higher level, based on their PSLE subject grades.

PSLE Eligibility criteria for offering higher level subjects:

| Course 	| PSLE Standard Grade 	| PSLE Foundation Grade 	| Option to offer subject at 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| N(A) 	| A*, A 	| - 	| Express 	|
| N(T) 	| A* , A 	| - 	| Express / N(A)  	|
| N(T) 	|  B, C 	| 1  	|  N(A) 	|

Parents will receive a notification via Parent Gateway to accept or reject the offer to take the subject at a higher level. Parents not onboard Parent Gateway will need to check your email for the notification. 

Do purchase the books once you have confirmed whether to accept or reject the offer.
