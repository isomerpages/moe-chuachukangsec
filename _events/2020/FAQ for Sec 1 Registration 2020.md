### FAQ MTL Matters

##### SECTION 1: SECOND LANGUAGE

Under MOE’s bilingual policy, all students must offer English and an official MTL. 

Learning difficulty in MTL is not a valid reason to apply for MTL exemption. MTL exemption should only be considered as a last resort for students under exceptional circumstances as highlighted below:

**a) Mid-stream Entry**

The student enters our school system mid-stream after prolonged absence from our school system and with no or weak prior learning of any of our MTLs or languages that can be offered as MTL-in-lieu. Applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and several factors will be taken into consideration holistically, including:

a. Duration and location(s) of the student’s stay overseas   
b. Prior language learning   
c. MTL curriculum and assessment demands 

**b) Special Educational Needs**

The student has certified Special Educational Needs (SEN) and shows severe difficulty in coping with his overall learning.

If you would like to apply for MTL exemption based on Point a) or b) above, please leave a message in the question segment of the registration form for our Head of Department for MTL to get in touch with you.
