##### PERSONALISED DIGITAL LEARNING PROGRAMME (PDLP)

6. What are the plans for the implementation of PDLP in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School?

*   Our school is a Phase 1 school for PDLP. We implemented the programme in 2021 with the following intended outcomes:

**Support the development of digital literacies**

*   Students will learn digital skills such as gathering and evaluating information online, interacting with the online community, and creating digital products.  

**Support self-directed and collaborative learning**

*   Students can access digital resources on their own to acquire knowledge about a topic of their interest beyond the curriculum. They can also share and build on one another’s ideas, and refine their own understanding. 

**Enhance Teaching & Learning**

*   The learning environment for the PDLP allows teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching. For example, instructions, activities and feedback for each student could be more tailored and relevant to students’ learning needs.   
    
**Conducive Learning Environment and Cyberwellness** 

*   All our current Sec 1-5 students are taught responsible habits in self-management as well as safe and responsible management of their Personal Learning Devices. Structures and processes are in place to ensure that the devices are kept and stored safely when in use. Students are also trained and inculcated with the use of e-classroom learning routines such as use of Google Classroom and Calendar for effective and efficient learning. CCKsians attend self-paced as well as teacher-led cyberwellness lessons to educate them on safe navigation in the cyber world. 

##### HIGHER MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES (HMTL) – FOR STUDENTS IN THE EXPRESS COURSE ONLY

7. Does CCKSS offer higher MT languages for CL, ML & TL?

*   Yes. CCKSS offers HMTL to students in the Express course who are competent in their Mother Tongue Languages. The objective of the HMTL course is to develop students’ fluency in all the four language skills and to help them gain a good understanding of Chinese / Malay / Indian history and culture.  

*   We offer HCL, HML & HTL within the school. Our students do not need to travel to other centres to take HMT.  

*   Interested students have to fulfill school-based criteria and benchmark that demonstrate their ability in the language before they can be offered HCL. 

Other Important Information:

*   HMTL lessons are conducted in school. Students will attend 4 hours of HMTL lessons per week – 3 hours during normal curriculum time and 1 hour after school.

*   HMTL students will sit for the GCE O-Level MTL Exam at the end of Secondary 3, and the GCE O-Level HMTL Exam at the end of Secondary 4.

*   As HMTL is a more demanding subject, compared to Express MTL, students offering HMTL must put in consistent effort to do well in the subject. They are not allowed to drop the subject and switch to Express MTL at any point in time.

*   Students whose performance in continual assessments and/or semestral examinations for HMTL is unsatisfactory may be channelled to the Express MTL course.

*   If a student uses HMT as his / her L1, he / she is not allowed to use MT in the computation of R5 / R4, as MOE only allows students to use ONE MT grade at any one time, and not both. If he uses EL as his L1, he can choose either the HMT or MT grade for the computation of R5/R4, whichever is better.

##### SUBJECT ALLOCATION

8. How many subjects are offered at Sec 3?

*   The maximum number of subjects offered for 2022 is 8.

##### SPECIAL PROGRAMMES

13. What special programmes are offered?

**Academic**

*   Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Robotics and Automation

The school’s niche for the ALP is Robotics and Automation. The study of robotics and automation technologies enables our students to gain practical understanding of this domain and provides them with avenues to apply and deepen their learning.  The programme also aims to develop 21st Century Competencies such as students’ critical and inventive thinking skills. 

Under this programme, students explore and challenge themselves to come up with creative and innovative solutions, as they learn to design and programme robots for practical use in a real world context. The school also partners Singapore Science Centre for extended learning opportunities for students who exhibit a keen interest in this area. Students in Secondary 3 Normal Technical Course may choose Mobile Robotics as a subject. In addition, students who have a passion in this area may choose the Robotics Club as their co-curricular activity. 

*   Elective modules (ITE) for NT; Advanced Elective Modules (Polytechnics) for Express & Normal Academic courses.

*    Subject-Based Banding (SBB) for EL, Math, Science and MT for students who are eligible. Students who are not eligible for SBB during Sec 1 Posting can be offered the opportunity to do EL, Math, Science or MT at a higher course level after the Sec 1 End-of Year Examination, if they meet the respective criteria. The criteria for SBB Inserts are:

*   75% or higher in the subject
*   60% or higher in the overall average
*   Positive learning attitude to cope with the higher academic demand

*   Conversational Chinese & Malay (CCM) Programme 

**Co-Curricular**

*    Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Student Youth Leadership 

Our LLP is Community Youth Leadership. Guided by the school’s vision and mission, the focus is to develop our students with the necessary life-skills to be responsible and contributing citizens of the future. The CCKSS student makes a consistent effort to develop his personal attributes such as self-reliance, perseverance and sense of responsibility to self, society and nation. 

All students attend courses based on student leadership challenge with specific focus for each level.  In addition, training is customised for specific student leader groups such as the Prefects, Class Committees, National Education Ambassadors, Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors and student leaders of the various co-curricular activities. 

Student are encouraged to apply their learning through their CCAs and community service where they will work in teams to serve others, and to demonstrate their leadership potential. They will understudy seniors in school or other schools to embark on community outreach projects. They will also leverage external partners for training and mentoring opportunities and apply their learning to initiate service learning projects in school and in the community. The annual Student Leaders’ Forum and Ideas@Work are two key platforms where student leaders get together to suggest ideas for school improvement, and thereafter present the ideas to school management. We envision every student to become responsible leaders who can lead themselves and others.

*    Global Classroom Experience for cultural immersion


##### TRANSPORTATION & TRAFFIC

14. What is the traffic condition like outside school in the morning?

*   We are situated along a belt of schools. The schools along this belt have staggered start times and as such traffic is generally not a major problem.
*   We do strongly encourage students to start their journey to school earlier, so that they arrive at school punctually and are in a better frame of mind for the school day ahead.

15. Where can I drop my child off in the morning if I am driving?

*   During good weather, parents can drop their child off along at the designated drop off point outside of the school, just after the school gate.
*   Parents are reminded not to drop their child off before the traffic light as this could clog up traffic and pose inconvenience to others. 
*   Parents are also reminded not to make illegal U-turns outside the school gate or at the traffic light as this may pose inconvenience and danger to other drivers and pedestrians.
*   During rainy weather, parents may drive their vehicle into the school driveway and drop their child off at the foyer which is sheltered.


##### GENERAL DISCIPLINE AND SCHOOL TONE

16. How is the discipline of the students in school like?

*   School tone is good and positive, with established systems and strong support from the Student Development Committee Team.

17. Is the environment in the school conducive for studying?

*   We constantly encourage and motivate our students to give their best and to maximise their potential.
*   We are also mindful that a good study environment is essential for teaching and learning to take place. Our teachers too are mindful of this and work towards cultivating a strong learning culture here in CCKSS.

18. Are mobile phones allowed in the school?

Parents are welcome to call the school’s General Office (Tel: 67655228) should they have any queries.


##### SCHOOL MERGER

**_Chua Chu Kang Secondary and Teck Whye Secondary will merge in 2023. The merged school will be located at Teck Whye Secondary School. Chua Chu Kang Secondary will not be participating in DSA-Sec and Sec 1 Posting from 2021 onwards._** 

21. Why are some schools with healthy enrolment merged? 

*   MOE’s priorities in planning schools are to **provide quality education**, meet demand for school places at both **national and local levels**, and ensure accessibility based on **proximity to housing developments** and **public transport**.  

*   Schools are identified for mergers based on factors such as 

*   **sufficient enrolment** to ensure critical mass for a wide range of educational programmes and co-curricular activities, 

*   the **geographical proximity** of the schools to be merged and 

*   the **infrastructure capacity to support the merged school.**

22. What are the considerations MOE has when deciding to merge schools, as opposed to relocating them to areas with higher demand? 

*   MOE will continue to review each case, taking into account factors such as the **impact of relocation on students’ educational experience**, and whether our **plans for building** of a new school campus in a new growth area have been firmed up or are still being finalised. But since there is **overall a steady drop in our birth rates nationally**, the **norm would still be for most school mergers to be merging into one** of the existing sites, rather than to merge into a new school site in a new growth area. 


23. How does MOE decide on the location of the merged school? 

*   The sites for the merged schools are chosen based on **overall geographical coverage** of primary and secondary schools, **accessibility to transport**, and the **quality of infrastructure**, such as the **age of the school buildings and facilities**.   
    

24. Will Teck Whye Secondary’s campus be able to accommodate the combined enrolment of the merged school? 

*   MOE will ensure that the students enrolled will have sufficient spaces to learn in. The physical infrastructure of schools is an important aspect of the overall learning environment as learning spaces and facilities support curriculum delivery. 
*   MOE will continue to work with the schools to ensure that they have the requisite infrastructure and resources to effectively deliver their curriculum.

25. What will be the names of the merged schools and what are some of the key considerations when MOE names schools? 

*   In naming the merged schools, MOE will consider a range of factors, including the schools’ history and heritage, enrolments, as well as stakeholders’ interests and sentiments of all schools involved. The names of the merged schools will be announced at a later date. 

26. Will there be a new set of uniform and new school crests for the merged schools? 

*   School leaders will consider the **histories of the merging schools**, the **sentiments of its stakeholders** and the **impact of such changes on its students**, **both past and present**, when making such decisions. Even when merged schools decide to forge a new school identity by changing its uniform and/or school crest, **they do not need to implement the changes immediately. Students who require financial assistance to purchase new uniform etc. may approach the school.**


27. We understand that CCKSS will not be taking in any Sec 1s in 2022, how can interested students join CCKSS? 

*   Interested Sec 1 students can consider choosing Teck Whye Secondary in 2022 and enjoy the best of both schools’ programmes, resources and expertise when both schools merge in 2023.
