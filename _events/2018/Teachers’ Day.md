# **Teachers’ Day**

Excited about Teachers’ Day? We’re all ready to celebrate our teachers too!  
  
MOE is organising a contest for Teachers’ Day and want to hear how the little moments spent with your teacher have inspired you. The best stories will be turned into an illustration and the winners will receive a copy of the illustration!  
  
Here’s how you can share your story:  
  
*   Write your story in a FB/IG post within 100 words  
    
*   Add the hashtag #TinyMoments2018 and make your post public so that we can read it.
