# **School-wide 3 Day Orientation Programme**

Students of CCKSS returned to school on the first day of 2021 and went through a three-day Orientation Programme to prepare them to start the year well. While the common aim across all levels is to allow the students time to build their class identity and spirit over the three days, the programme is customised to meet our specific objectives for the different groups of students.

Our objectives for the Secondary One students are to help ensure a smooth transition to secondary school and develop self-management skills. This was done through workshops, tours of the school and CCAs, and Circle Time with their Form Teachers. 

After one year in CCKSS, we aim for the Secondary Two students to build their peer leadership skills and develop empathy. The majority of the three days was dedicated to The Empathy Project which helped the students to better understand their classmates. Interclass Games were also organised for opportunities to develop their peer leadership skills. 

The Secondary Three students went through workshops to equip them with the skills to better manage their time and develop a resilient mindset. As they settle into their new classes with new subject combinations, the skills acquired in these workshops will prepare them for what is ahead. 

As they enter the final year in CCKSS, the Secondary Four and Five students took part in workshops where they set clear goals for themselves, develop the drive to meet these goals and cultivate a mindset of striving for excellence. To better prepare them after they leave the school, they also explored the different pathways after the national examinations. The three day programme culminated in a townhall meeting with the School Management Committee to exchange ideas and propose ways to make the school a better learning environment for their juniors. 

At the end of the three days, the students were ready to start the year on the right note. 

“Through the workshops during our orientation, I learned the importance of time management and how to properly schedule my timetable. I find it easier to get tasks done in time without procrastination! It was definitely a fruitful three days we went through which better prepared us to start the year.” (Sua Jia Wen, 3/6)
