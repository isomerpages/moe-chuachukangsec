CCKSS celebrated Chinese New Year on 11th February 2021. In what is becoming the norm, the celebration was a mix of live and recorded performances broadcasted live for everyone’s enjoyment in the classrooms. This did not mean that students simply sat through the performances, as they were actively engaged in a variety of tasks and competitions.
