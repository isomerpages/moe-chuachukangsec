<h2><strong>Post-Exam Programme 2025: Confidence, Empathy and Contribution in Action</strong></h2>
<p>After the exam period, CCKS students took part in a meaningful Post-Exam
Programme centred on personal growth, character and community. Each level
explored a unique theme — <strong>Secondary 1: Confident CCKSian</strong>, <strong>Secondary 2: Empathetic Team Player</strong> and <strong>Secondary 3: Active Contributor</strong> —
through a series of enriching activities.</p>
<p>The Secondary 1 students spent the programme building confidence and self-identity.
They took part in aesthetic workshops, the Mother Tongue Reading Showcase
and Education and Career Guidance (ECG) sessions to develop their communication
skills and reflect on their strengths. Class bonding activities, cyber
wellness and student well-being talks, as well as form teacher time and
end-of-year reflections, helped them grow more self-assured and connected
as young CCKSians.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Secondary 2 students focused on empathy and teamwork. A highlight of their
programme was the <em>Race to Sustainability!</em> learning journey at Gardens
by the Bay, where they worked together to explore environmental issues.
Their meaningful participation caught public attention — they even made
it into the local newspapers, proudly representing the school. Students
also attended subject combination and ECG briefings, aesthetic and cyber
wellness workshops, and reflection sessions that strengthened their ability
to understand and support others.</p>

<p>For the Secondary 3 cohort, the programme encouraged them to become active
contributors as they prepare for their senior years. They attended ECG
briefings and went on learning journeys to various industries to explore
future pathways. The dragon boating experience at Kallang Water Sports
Centre was a memorable test of teamwork, resilience and leadership. The
programme concluded with school cleaning, reflection and form teacher time,
reinforcing responsibility and service.</p>

<p>This year’s Post-Exam Programme was more than just a break from academics
— it was a celebration of growth in character, compassion and contribution.
Our students demonstrated what it means to be true CCKSians: confident,
empathetic and ready to make a difference.</p>
