<h1><strong>Secondary One Camp 2025</strong></h1>
<p>This week, our Sec 1 CCKSians embarked on their outdoor education journey
in two exciting locations. One group took on Kallang Basin, building water
confidence and powering through dragon boating, before navigating the Sports
Hub in an orienteering challenge. The other group stayed back at camp,
conquered high and low elements, learned outdoor cooking, and showed teamwork
and grit every step of the way.
<br>
<br>As the sun set, both groups came together to pitch their tents and prepared
themselves for the next day's thrilling activities—where they swapped activities
and built new memories. Of course, the last night of camp - campfire night
- was the most exciting night of all!</p>
<p>Our Secondary One Camp may have been short, but the impact was deep. From
the high ropes at Home Team NS to paddling across Kallang Basin, our students
discovered that real strength isn’t just about muscles or medals — it’s
about showing up for each other, lifting one another up, and growing as
one. They stepped out of their comfort zones and into community. They came
as classmates… and left as teammates.</p>
