<h3><strong>2. SCHOOL HOURS</strong></h3>
<h4>2.1 What are the school’s start and end times?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Morning flag-raising will begin at 0800. Students must be punctual for
school and are encouraged to report earlier before 0750 to do quiet reading

</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>3. NUMBER OF SEC 1 CLASSES FOR 2025</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>3.1 How many classes are there for Secondary 1 in 2025?</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In 2024, we had 8 Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) classes. They were
mixed classes of students taking subjects at G1, G2 and G3 levels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. HIGHER MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES (HMTL) – FOR STUDENTS TAKING G3 MTL ONLY</strong></h3>
<h4>4.1 Does CCKSS offer Higher MT languages for CL, ML &amp; TL?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>CCKSS offers HMTL to students in the G3 course of study who are competent
in their Mother Tongue Language. The objective of the HMTL course is to
develop students’ strengths &amp; interest in all their chosen Mother Tongue
Languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCL, HML &amp; HTL classes are offered within the school. Students do
not need to travel to other centres to take HMTL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prospective students must demonstrate their competence in the language
before they can be offered HMTL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.2 Other Important Information:</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HMTL lessons are conducted in school. Students will attend 4 hours of
HMTL lessons per week – 3 hours during normal curriculum time and 1 hour
after school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HMTL students will sit for the GCE O-Level MTL Exam at the end of Secondary
3, and the GCE O-Level HMTL Exam at the end of Secondary 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As HMTL is a more demanding subject, compared to G3 MTL, students offering
HMTL must put in consistent effort to do well. They are not allowed to
drop the subject and switch to G3 MTL at any point in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a student uses HMT as his/her L1, he/she is not allowed to use MT in
the computation of R5/R4, as MOE only allows students to use ONE MT grade
at any one time, and not both. If he/she uses EL as his L1, he/she can
choose either the HMT or MT grade for the computation of R5/R4, whichever
is better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hindi classes will be held within the school premises for the year 2026.
However, this arrangement is reviewed on a yearly basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
