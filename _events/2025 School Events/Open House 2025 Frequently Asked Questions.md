<p>Remarks:</p>
<p>Meeting the indicative cut-off point (COP) does not guarantee admission
to the school. The current year’s PSLE Score ranges may vary, depending
on the demand pattern and cohort size.</p>

<h3><strong>2. SCHOOL HOURS</strong></h3>
<h4>2.1 What are the school’s start and end times?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Morning flag-raising will begin at 0800. Students must be punctual for
school and are encouraged to report earlier before 0750 to do quiet reading
to prepare for the school day. Lessons will generally end between 2.30pm
to 3.30pm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>3. NUMBER OF SEC 1 CLASSES FOR 2025</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>3.1 How many classes are there for Secondary 1 in 2025?</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In 2024, we had 8 Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) classes. They were
mixed classes of students taking subjects at G1, G2 and G3 levels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>4. HIGHER MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES (HMTL) – FOR STUDENTS TAKING G3 MTL ONLY</strong></h3>
<h4>4.1 Does CCKSS offer Higher MT languages for CL, ML &amp; TL?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>CCKSS offers HMTL to students in the G3 course of study who are competent
in their Mother Tongue Language. The objective of the HMTL course is to
develop students’ strengths &amp; interest in all their chosen Mother Tongue
Languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCL, HML &amp; HTL classes are offered within the school. Students do
not need to travel to other centres to take HMTL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prospective students must demonstrate their competence in the language
before they can be offered HMTL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.2 Other Important Information:</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HMTL lessons are conducted in school. Students will attend 4 hours of
HMTL lessons per week – 3 hours during normal curriculum time and 1 hour
after school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HMTL students will sit for the GCE O-Level MTL Exam at the end of Secondary
3, and the GCE O-Level HMTL Exam at the end of Secondary 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As HMTL is a more demanding subject, compared to G3 MTL, students offering
HMTL must put in consistent effort to do well. They are not allowed to
drop the subject and switch to G3 MTL at any point in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a student uses HMT as his/her L1, he/she is not allowed to use MT in
the computation of R5/R4, as MOE only allows students to use ONE MT grade
at any one time, and not both. If he/she uses EL as his L1, he/she can
choose either the HMT or MT grade for the computation of R5/R4, whichever
is better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hindi classes will be held within the school premises for the year 2026.
However, this arrangement is reviewed on a yearly basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.FULL SUBJECT BASED BANDING</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop
multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of
our students, our Lower Secondary students are in mixed form classes offering
subjects at more or less demanding levels, calibrated to balance between
greater customization of learning while ensuring they benefit from a broad-based
education focused on developing strong fundamentals and stretching students
to their fullest potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are six Common Curriculum subjects that students attend together
in their mixed form classes, i.e. Art, Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE), Design and Technology (D&amp;T), Food and Consumer Education (FCE),
Music, and Physical Education (PE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the learning outcomes will be common for all students, teachers
will differentiate their teaching to meet the learning needs of different
learner profiles to ensure that they continue to be sufficiently supported
and challenged in their learning. This will allow students to learn at
a suitable pace while ensuring that a high level of quality and rigour
in teaching is maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All secondary school students can offer English Language, Mother Tongue
Languages, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level from the start
of Secondary One based on students' PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each
subject. This provision will continue under Full SBB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond the start of Secondary One, students may also offer these subjects
at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school</p>

<p>Students in schools that are implementing Full SBB will also be able to
offer Humanities subjects (Geography, History, and Literature in English)
at a more demanding level from Secondary Two. The criteria for taking Humanities
at a more demanding level will be based on students' aptitude for and interest
in these subjects at Secondary One.</p>
