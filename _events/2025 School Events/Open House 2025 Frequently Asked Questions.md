<h3>2. SCHOOL HOURS</h3>
<h4>2.1 What are the school’s start and end times?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Morning flag-raising will begin at 0800. Students must be punctual for
school and are encouraged to report earlier before 0750 to do quiet reading
to prepare for the school day. Lessons will generally end between 2.30pm
to 3.30pm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>3. NUMBER OF SEC 1 CLASSES FOR 2025</h3>
<h4>3.1 How many classes are there for Secondary 1 in 2025?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>In 2025, we had 8 Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) classes. They were
mixed classes of students taking subjects at G1, G2 and G3 levels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. HIGHER MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES (HMTL) – FOR STUDENTS TAKING G3 MTL ONLY</h3>
<h4>4.1 Does CCKSS offer Higher MT languages for CL, ML &amp; TL?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>CCKSS offers HMTL to students in the G3 course of study who are competent
in their Mother Tongue Language. The objective of the HMTL course is to
develop students’ strengths &amp; interest in all their chosen Mother Tongue
Languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HCL, HML &amp; HTL classes are offered <u>within</u> the school. Students
do not need to travel to other centres to take HMTL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prospective students must demonstrate their competence in the language
before they can be offered HMTL.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.2 Other Important Information:</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>HMTL lessons are conducted in school. Students will attend 4 hours of
HMTL lessons per week – 3 hours during normal curriculum time and 1 hour
after school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HMTL students will sit for the GCE O-Level MTL Exam at the end of Secondary
3, and the GCE O-Level HMTL Exam at the end of Secondary 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As HMTL is a more demanding subject, compared to G3 MTL, students offering
HMTL must put in consistent effort to do well. They are not allowed to
drop the subject and switch to G3 MTL at any point in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a student uses HMT as his/her L1, he/she is not allowed to use MT in
the computation of R5/R4, as MOE only allows students to use <u>ONE MT grade</u> at
any one time, and not both. If he/she uses EL as his L1, he/she can choose
either the HMT or MT grade for the computation of R5/R4, whichever is better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hindi classes will be held within the school premises for the year 2026.
However, this arrangement is reviewed on a yearly basis.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.FULL SUBJECT BASED BANDING</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop
multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of
our students, our Lower Secondary students are in mixed form classes offering
subjects at more or less demanding levels, calibrated to balance between
greater customization of learning while ensuring they benefit from a broad-based
education focused on developing strong fundamentals and stretching students
to their fullest potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are six Common Curriculum subjects that students attend together
in their mixed form classes, i.e. Art, Character and Citizenship Education
(CCE), Design and Technology (D&amp;T), Food and Consumer Education (FCE),
Music, and Physical Education (PE).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the learning outcomes will be common for all students, teachers
will differentiate their teaching to meet the learning needs of different
learner profiles to ensure that they continue to be sufficiently supported
and challenged in their learning. This will allow students to learn at
a suitable pace while ensuring that a high level of quality and rigour
in teaching is maintained.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All secondary school students can offer <strong>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science</strong> at
a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students'
PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject. This provision will continue
under Full SBB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond the start of Secondary One, students may also offer these subjects
at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school</p>

<p>• Under Full SBB, the GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Level examinations will be replaced
with the new Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC)
examinations. This will apply for the 2024 Secondary One cohort. From 2027,
the national certification will reflect the subject level at which each
subject is taken.</p>
<h3>7. PERSONAL LEARNING DEVICE (PLD)</h3>
<h4>7.1 Will my child / ward get a Personal Learning Device next year?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As part of the National Digital Literacy Programme, every secondary student
would have their own Personal Learning Device (PLD) at Secondary 1. Parents
/ guardians will need to opt in to the programme so that the school can
make a bulk purchase. Students can pay for the device through their Edusave
accounts. For students from lower-income households, further subsidies
are provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PLD that is used by Chua Chu Kang Secondary students currently is
the Chromebook. The new cohort of Secondary 1 students will continue to
purchase the Chromebook too. Complemented by enhanced internet connectivity
in schools, PLDs will better support teaching and learning and develop
students' digital literacies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>8. CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (CCAs)</h3>

<h3>9. SPECIAL PROGRAMMES</h3>
<h4>9.1 What Special Programmes are offered in CCKSS?</h4>
<p><strong><u>Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Sustainable Living for a Resilient Future</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The ALP at CCKSS connects academic learning to real-world applications,
enhancing students' motivation to acquire essential skills and knowledge
for their futures</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Focus Areas:</strong>
</p>
<p>The ALP emphasises Sustainable Living for a Resilient Future through three
main pillars:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sustainable Food Systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sustainable Practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green Conservation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Inspire STEM Interest:</strong> Engaging real-world activities
spark curiosity in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Critical and Creative Thinkers:</strong> Students develop
adaptability, critical thinking, and inventiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop Design Thinkers:</strong> Students learn to solve and identify
problems using design thinking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Tiered Development (5 Es):</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Tier 1 - Excite:</strong> Ignite interest in sustainability and
STEM with engaging, real-world examples.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Orchid Hybridisation Programme (Biology)</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Orchid Hybridisation Programme is a series of workshops where students
learn about the physiology and anatomy of an orchid plant and the process
of orchid hybridisation. This provides a unique real-world context for
learning relevant topics in the Pure Biology and Science (Biology) syllabi.
In recent years, the school has expanded its programme and developed the
Design and Research Space for Orchid Hybridisation where students can carry
out the hybridisation process under laboratory conditions and try their
hands at creating new orchid hybrids.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>Immersive Classroom (Virtual Reality)</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Virtual Reality (VR) is revolutionizing education by immersing students
in interactive, hands-on experiences that make complex topics more engaging
and easier to understand. With VR, students can explore the human bloodstream
at a cellular level, walk through historical cities, or study geography
by interacting with landforms in Google Earth, transforming abstract concepts
into vivid, real-world experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beyond academics, VR unleashes creativity by enabling students to practice
sports in virtual environments, create stunning 3D art in imagined environments,
or go on virtual field trips to explore faraway cities and cultural landmarks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This immersive approach not only boosts creativity but also enhances retention
by turning lessons into captivating journeys. Additionally, VR fuels students'
imagination, inspiring them to dive deeper into research and write more
imaginative stories as they experience rich, immersive worlds firsthand.
By blending learning with exploration, VR sparks curiosity, expands horizons,
and enriches education in ways previously unimaginable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Community Youth Leadership</u></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Our LLP is Community Youth Leadership. The aim of the programme is to
develop our students with the necessary life-skills to be responsible and
contributing citizens of the future. A CCKSian makes a consistent effort
to develop his/her personal attributes such as self-reliance, perseverance,
and a sense of responsibility to self, society, and nation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All CCKSians attend courses based on the Student Leadership Challenge
with a specific focus for each level. In addition, training is customised
for specific student leader groups such as the Student Councillors, Peer
Support Leaders, Class Leaders and CCA Leaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CCKSians are encouraged to apply their learning through their CCAs and
community service where they will work in teams to serve others, and to
demonstrate their leadership potential. Adopting the Design Thinking Framework
for Values-in-Action programme enables students to develop empathy for
others &amp; create solutions to meet their needs. CCKSians are also given
opportunities to initiate service-learning projects in school and in the
community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>CCKSS Global Connect</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>CCKSS Global Connect Overseas Programme (CGC)</strong> is the school’s<strong> signature initiative</strong> to
nurture global-minded, effective communicators. Through partnership with
overseas schools, our <strong>secondary 3 students</strong> engage in civic
&amp; cultural learning via <strong>educational exchanges, site visits &amp; Global VIA projects.</strong>
</p>
<p>Since its launch in <strong>2023 (Chiang Rai, Thailand)</strong>, the programme
has expanded to include <strong>Vietnam, Indonesia</strong> and <strong>China</strong>,
with new partnerships in <strong>Japan </strong>and another <strong>Chinese province </strong>planned
for 2026.</p>
<p>Overseas experiences allow for authentic learning to <strong>broaden students’ learning experiences </strong>and <strong>deepen students’ acquisition of 21CC</strong>.
These will enable students to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Work effectively with peers from diverse cultural backgrounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage in new and unfamiliar global contexts.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Participants consistently share that the programme strengthened their<strong> resilience, respect</strong> and <strong>intercultural understanding</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>10. TRANSPORTATION &amp; TRAFFIC</h3>
<h4>10.1 What is the traffic condition like outside school in the morning?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We are situated along a belt of schools. The schools along this belt have
staggered start times and as such traffic is not a major problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We strongly encourage students to start their journey to school earlier,
so that they arrive at school punctually and are in a better frame of mind
for the school day ahead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>10.2 Where can I drop my child / ward off in the morning if I am driving?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Parents / guardians can drop their child / ward off along at the designated
drop-off point inside the school, after the school gate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>11. GENERAL DISCIPLINE AND SCHOOL TONE</h3>
<h4>11.1 How is the discipline of the students in school like?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The school discipline tone is positive, with established systems and strong
support from the Student Development Team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school has zero tolerance for students who engage in teasing, harassment
or bullying. Students who commit such offences will be dealt with according

</li>
<li>
<p>Conducive study spaces can be found in the library and students may make
use of study tables and chairs located outside the Computer Labs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>11.3 Are handphones allowed in the school?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Students learn well when there is order, discipline and minimal distraction.
It is important that all CCKSians learn to be responsible and discerning
users of technology. We would strongly advise parents / guardians, if they
wish their children / ward to bring a mobile phone to school, to purchase
for your child only a simple mobile phone for communication purposes. This
is to minimize distraction and replacement costs in the case of loss or
damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition to the CCE and Cyber Wellness curriculum, our school has in
place the following rules and policies to ensure responsible use of mobile
devices in school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will keep their mobile phones / electronic devices in assigned
lockers at the start of the day. Mobile phones / electronic devices can
only be used after the end of curriculum hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should parents / guardians need to contact their child / ward, or in the
case of an emergency, they may call the school office. For non-emergency
cases, they should SMS their child / ward and leave a message for him /
her to return a call as soon as he / she reads the message after school
dismissal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
