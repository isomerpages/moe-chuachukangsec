<h3><strong>Total Defence Day 2025</strong></h3>
<p>TDD Exercise SG Ready 2025 reminds us of the importance of being resilient
and prepared for crises and challenges that Singapore faces. During this
power disruption simulation exercise, CCKSIANS explored the implications
of energy security and discussed how every individual plays a role in contributing
to Singapore’s energy future.
<br>
<br>While demonstrating our school values of respect, resilience, integrity,
care, and enterprise, students reflected on the significance of energy
security and learnt not to take it for granted.
<br>
<br>During the assembly, students deepened their understanding of Singapore’s
energy challenges through insightful discussions and a talk on solar energy.
They also shared reflections on adapting to disruptions, recited a poem
inspired by their experiences, and ended on a high note with the song “Carry
Forth the Fire.”</p>
