<h1><strong>Sports Challenge 2025</strong></h1>
<p>The Sports Challenge is one of the most exciting and highly anticipated
events in the CCKS calendar, and this year’s edition on 22nd May was nothing
short of spectacular! The entire school came alive with energy, laughter,
and loud cheers as students competed in thrilling matches spread out across
the campus. Our enthusiastic Sec 1s showed great teamwork in basketball
and Captain’s Ball, while the spirited Sec 2s impressed with their skills
in frisbee and volleyball. The Sec 3s brought their A-game to intense floorball
and table tennis matches, and the senior Sec 4 and 5 students joined forces
to dominate in action-packed games of Tchoukball and football. One of the
most exciting moments of the day was the Sec 1–4 Relay Run, where all levels
came together in a high-energy race, cheered on by their classmates waving
handmade signs and chanting creative cheers. Everywhere you looked, there
was an atmosphere of friendly rivalry, sportsmanship, and school pride.
It was a day of pure adrenaline and joy, where memories were made, bonds
were strengthened, and the CCKS spirit truly shone bright!</p>
