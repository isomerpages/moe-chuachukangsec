<h2><strong>Pongal Celebrations @ CCKSS!</strong></h2>
<p>Our CCKSians enjoyed the colourful and joyful <em>Pongal</em> celebrations
which are a highlight every year during morning assembly. The celebrations
started when our principal, Mr Cheng, and the school leaders, lit the traditional
lamp and added rice and spices to the <em>pongal </em>pot. Amidst the sounds
of song and dance, they entered the school hall with members of the Mother
Tongue Department and several of the concert performers. Everyone was soon
enthralled by the vibrant performance of the <em>Thapattam </em>drum dance,
the <em>Pol Kai Kuthirai </em>horse dance and the melodious voices of Mr
Benjamin Pooi and Mdm Nurul Izzati who serenaded the audience with a Tamil
song. With such vibrancy and excitement, we are looking forward to next
year's celebrations!</p>
