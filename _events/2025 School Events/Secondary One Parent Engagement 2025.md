<h2><strong>Secondary One Parent Engagement</strong></h2>
<p>The Secondary One Orientation concluded with a heartwarming finale. Our
Principal shared the school’s educational principles with parents and guardians
as well as emphasised the importance of partnerships with parents. The
chairperson of the Parents' Support Group also showcased the strong collaboration
between our school and parents. To cap off the evening, students dazzled
the audience with a spirited mass dance they had mastered during orientation,
impressing parents with their energy and unity. This vibrant celebration
reflected the school’s commitment to fostering a close-knit, supportive
community, setting a positive tone for the year ahead.</p>
