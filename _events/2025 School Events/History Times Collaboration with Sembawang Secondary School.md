<h1><strong>History Times Collaboration with Sembawang Secondary School</strong></h1>
<p>CCKSians connected with their peers from Sembawang Secondary School via
"The History Times" [a signature cross-schools history talent development
program], jointly organized by both schools, supported by the Knowledge
Building National Community</p>
<p>In line with our 2025 theme, the "Inventions &amp; Innovations of the
20th Century", the session kicked off with students demonstrating strong
dispositions of their adaptive &amp; inventive thinking with them designing,
carrying out &amp; synthesising the different groups' ice-breaker activities</p>
<p>Following which, they gained valuable insights &amp; inspiration on possible
historical angles &amp; perspectives that they could take as they hear
the sharing by our esteemed guest speakers, that ranges from the lens of
scientific &amp; technological inventions to musical &amp; socio-cultural
innovations</p>
<p>Looking forward to the next engaging session at CCKSS and the groups'
creative products &amp; historical analysis as Guardians of the Past &amp;
Curators of our Stories</p>
