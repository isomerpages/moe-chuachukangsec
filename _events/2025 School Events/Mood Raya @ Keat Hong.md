<h2><strong>Mood Raya @ Keat Hong</strong></h2>
<p>Our CCKSians truly have empathetic hearts to serve the community! Although
it was a Sunday and many Muslim families were still visiting friends and
relatives over the weekend, our Muslim CCKSian students, dressed in vintage
kebayas, spent their Sunday volunteering at Mood Raya @ Keat Hong - a 1965
themed community Hari Raya celebration - where they helped to man the photo
booth and interacted with residents. In the true spirit of inter-religious
and inter-racial learning, they also roped in non-Muslim friends to join
in the festivities and given the photos taken, everyone had a good time!</p>
