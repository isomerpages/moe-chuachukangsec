<h2><strong>Our Sec 1s Receive Their PLDs!</strong></h2>
<p>There was plenty of excitement last week when our Sec 1 CCKSians unboxed
their personal learning devices (PLDs) together as a cohort. Along with
their new Chromebooks, our Sec 1 CCKSians also received baseline training
in Google's suite of productivity tools as well as some important tips
on Cyberwellness.</p>
<p>Soon, Home Based Learning (HBL) will be a breeze for our Sec 1 CCKSians
as they will be able to enjoy the use of the Digital Homework Board as
a way to manage their assignments. Collaborative learning via padlet and
other online tools will make classroom lessons more interactive and fun!</p>
<p>From everyone's excited expression, the PLD is certainly a very welcome
tool for learning!</p>
