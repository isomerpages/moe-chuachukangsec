<h2><strong>Tulips in Bloom: Our Creative CCKSians Exhibit Mosaic Art at Gardens by the Bay</strong></h2>
<p>Once again our CCKSians have done us proud! Our Art Club members in collaboration
with Gardens By The Bay for Tulipmania, contributed to 3 stunning mosaic
art installations in the likeness of Turkiye's famous mosaic tiles. The
mosaic art installations are now on display at GBTB during the Tulipmania
festival. Our CCKSians also interacted confidently with Minister Chan Chun
Sing, Turkiye's ambassador, Mr Mehmet Burçin Gönenli and foreign guests.
3 of our Girl Guides also served as guides during the exhibition. Truly
proud of our CCKSians!</p>
