<h1><strong>Teachers' Day Celebrations</strong></h1>
<p>Every year, Teachers' Day is a special occasion to honour the people who
guide us, inspire us, and shape our future—our teachers. This day is not
only a celebration of their hard work but also an opportunity for us, as
CCKSians, to express our heartfelt gratitude and respect.</p>
<p>The day began with a warm and lively class party organized by the class
leaders for their form teachers. With delicious home-cooked food, thoughtful
gifts, and cheerful games and quizzes, the classrooms were filled with
laughter and joy. It was a heartwarming reminder that appreciation does
not always come in grand gestures—sometimes, the little things mean the
most.</p>
<p>But of course, the highlight awaited everyone: the grand Teacher’s Day
concert! As always, the concert exceeded expectations. Our talented student
performers lit up the stage with music, dance, and drama, each performance
reflecting the deep admiration we hold for our teachers. Adding to the
festive mood, our dedicated Parents’ Support Group (PSG) surprised the
teachers with a lovely cup-and-warmer set—just the thing to keep coffee
warm in between lessons. Thoughtful and practical, it was a gift cherished
by all!</p>
<p>And then came the moment no one expected—the true star of the hour, our
very own Mr. Ng Aik Song! Dancing as stylishly as his students, Mr. Ng
joined the modern dancers on stage with dazzling energy, leaving the audience
in awe. His performance was nothing short of spectacular, and within hours,
clips of it went viral on social media! It was a perfect reminder that
our teachers are not only mentors but also vibrant role models who inspire
in every way.</p>
<p>As the celebrations came to a close, the atmosphere turned even more touching
when former students returned to greet their teachers. Their presence was
a living testament to the strong bonds forged in our classrooms—proof that
a teacher’s influence truly lasts a lifetime.</p>
<p>On this special day, we celebrate not just teaching, but the heart, soul,
and love that our teachers pour into everything they do. To all the wonderful
teachers of CCKS and beyond—Happy Teachers' Day! You make the world brighter,
kinder, and wiser with your dedication.</p>
