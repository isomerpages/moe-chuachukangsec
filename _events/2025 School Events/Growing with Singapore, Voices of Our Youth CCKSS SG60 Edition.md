<h1><strong>Growing with Singapore, Voices of Our Youth CCKSS SG60 Edition</strong></h1>
<p>Over the past three months, our Secondary 3 and 4 students, guided by
their teachers, Ms Klara Tan, Mr Hubert Yeo and Mr Melvin Chan, have written
and designed a collection of poems, prose, artwork, and letters to commemorate
Singapore’s 60<sup>th</sup> birthday, our diamond jubilee. The title of
this publication is <em>Growing with Singapore: Voices of our Youth – CCKSS SG60 Edition</em>.</p>
<p>Their works have been categorised into seven different themes: ‘Home’,
‘Unity in Diversity’, ‘Memories’, ‘Future &amp; Hope’ &nbsp;‘Resilience’,
‘Places in Local Life’ and ‘Youth’. Each piece of work is a personal tribute
to our nation and a celebration of what it means to call Singapore home!</p>
<p>We hope that you will enjoy reading this labour of love from our CCKSians:</p>
