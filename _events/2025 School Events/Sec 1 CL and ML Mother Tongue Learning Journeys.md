<h2><strong>Sec 1 CL and ML Mother Tongue Learning Journeys</strong></h2>
<p>Our Sec 1 Chinese and Malay Mother Tongue Language CCKSians had a great
time deepening their knowledge and appreciation of their ethnic heritage
with exciting learning journeys to the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language
(SCCL) and Kampong Glam!</p>
<p>Our Sec 1 CCKSians who visited the “SINGAPO人” exhibition at SCCL took
the opportunity, through diverse stories and experiences, to explore what
makes our Singaporean identity so unique. From history to culture, they
learned, connected, and gained a deeper sense of belonging. From the interactive
and eye-catching visuals and their delighted expressions, this learning
journey was a hit!</p>

<p>Our Sec 1 CCKSians who visited Kampong Glam explored the history and Islamic
influences of the area with a focus on the Sultan Mosque's role in the
Malay community. As they followed their teachers, they also picked up research
and observation skills as they gathered information from the heritage trail
boards in the area.</p>
<p>Some of the heritage sites visited by the students included Sultan Mosque,
Madrasah Alsagoff, Gedung Kuning, and Aliwal Arts Centre. In addition,
our Sec 1 CCKSians visited Arab Street to check out the batik stores and
the best <em>teh tarik </em>at Bhai Teh Sarbat! They also walked along Bussorah
Street, stopping at Jamal Kazura, Wardah Books and Royal Fragrance.</p>
<p>Our Sec 1 CCKSians had lots of fun and bonded more with the classmates
as they collaborated on tasks together. This learning journey too was a
hit!</p>
