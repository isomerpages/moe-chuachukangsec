<h2><strong>Orienteering Skills Programme</strong></h2>
<p>On March 26th and April 3rd, Secondary 3 students participated in an engaging
orienteering skills development program at the scenic Jurong Lake Gardens.
This initiative was part of their preparation for the upcoming Ministry
of Education (MOE) Outdoor Adventure Learning (OBS) challenge.</p>
<p>The sessions, although interrupted by unpredictable weather conditions,
demonstrated the resilience and adaptability of both trainers and students.
Rather than allowing the rain to hinder their progress, the participants
utilized sheltered areas within the gardens, transforming potential setbacks
into opportunities for learning.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of experienced trainers, students practiced essential
navigation techniques using maps and compasses, honing their skills in
tracking their paths even amidst adverse conditions. The sheltered spots
provided a perfect setting for discussions on strategy and teamwork, reinforcing
the importance of collaboration during the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>The orienteering sessions at Jurong Lake Gardens not only equipped the
students with important technical skills but also instilled a sense of
adaptability, ensuring they are ready to face any challenges head-on during
their upcoming outdoor adventures.</p>
