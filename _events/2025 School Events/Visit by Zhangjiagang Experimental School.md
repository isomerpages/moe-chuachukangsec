<h3><strong>Visit by Zhangjiagang Experimental School</strong></h3>
<p>On 20 and 21 January, we were honoured to receive a visit from our friends
from Zhangjiagang Experimental School whom we visited in November 2024.
Leading the group of 30 students and 2 teachers was the school's Principal,
Mr Zhang Lin. Our guests were treated to a traditional <em>kompang and bunga manggar </em>welcome
from our Malay Language students and a dazzling display of swordsmanship
from our <em>Wushu</em> students.</p>
<p>Our CCKSians who travelled to China last year were excited to meet their
new friends and served as buddies for the visit. On the first day, our
friends and their CCKSian buddies attended cultural workshops together
(<em>Pongal</em> pot painting, Jawi script writing and fabric tie-dye).
We were also treated to a unique Design &amp; Technology craft session
where the students learnt to make luggage tags from our expert, Mr Walter!</p>
<p>On the second day, everyone enjoyed the Virtual Reality in Education segment
where students had a change to play doctor through interaction with a chatbot
and explored different virtual reality stations where they visited museums,
rode roller coasters and exercised their creativity with the tilt brush
programme! Our friends were also treated to an informative session at our
Design and Research Space for Urban Farming where Mdm Normala and Mrs Trina
Wong explained to them the different uses of local herbs and spices. A
treat was also in store with home-brewed lemongrass and cinnamon tea and
pandan cake by Mdm Haryani! Our visitors certainly enjoyed Day 2's activities!</p>
<p>Our two schools exchanged school gifts and our CCKSians and their buddies
also wrote appreciation notes to one another. After a sumptuous lunch and
promises to meet again in November 2025, we bade farewell to our friends!</p>
<p><strong><em>我们希望很快能见到您，我们非常享受与您的访问！</em></strong>
