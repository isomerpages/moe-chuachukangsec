<h2><strong>Graduation Day &amp; Parent Support Group Graduation Day Gifts 2025</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Celebrating Our Graduating Sec 4 &amp; 5 CCKSians: A Journey of Growth, Grit, and Gratitude</strong>
</p>
<p>As the school year draws to a close, our Sec 4 and 5 CCKSians stand at
the threshold of a new chapter — one filled with promise, purpose, and
pride. After years of learning, laughter, and shared memories, they are
ready to take flight and bring with them the spirit of perseverance and
compassion that defines the CCKSS family.</p>
<p>The road to graduation has not been without challenges, especially with
the pressures of the N and O Level examinations. Yet, our CCKSians have
shown resilience and determination every step of the way. Their teachers
have guided them with care, their peers have supported them with camaraderie,
and their parents have cheered them on with unwavering love.</p>
<p>To make this milestone even more special, the Parent Support Group (PSG)
came together with great enthusiasm and heart. During a meeting marked
by laughter and teamwork, parents lovingly packed small gift bags — tokens
of encouragement to remind our graduating students that their hard work
is seen and celebrated. These thoughtful gifts were distributed to each
Sec 4 and 5 student, bringing smiles, warmth, and an extra boost of motivation
as they gear up for their national examinations.</p>
<p>These simple gestures reflect the spirit of community that CCKSS is proud
of — one where teachers, parents, and students walk hand in hand to nurture
confidence, character, and care.</p>
<p>As our graduating cohort takes their final steps through the school gates,
we wish them courage and clarity for the journey ahead. Remember, CCKSians
— you are stronger than you think, and this is only the beginning of your
amazing story.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to our Sec 4 and 5 graduates of 2025!</strong>
<br>May your hard work shine bright in your exams, and may you continue to
make your CCKSS family proud.</p>
