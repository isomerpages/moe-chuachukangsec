<p>On 19 January, our CCKSians and TL Centre students participated in the
Bukit Panjang Pongal celebrations, engaging with the local community. They
gained valuable hands-on experience of the Pongal festival traditions.
We were also heartened to include CCKSians from other races who expressed
interest in joining the celebrations to enrich their cross-cultural knowledge.
Guided by their classmates, they had a lot of fun trying out Indian traditional
games and witnessing the boiling over of the pongal pot.</p>
<p>Our TL students also shared their knowledge of traditional games with
community members, fostering meaningful interactions. Their confidence
at interacting with the community and sharing what they knew about the
games certainly allowed many people to learn more about the Tamil culture
and traditions. We look forward to bringing the Pongal celebrations to
our school!</p>
<p>அனைவருக்கும் இனிய பொங்கல் நல்வாழ்த்துக்கள்!</p>
