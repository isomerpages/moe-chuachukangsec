<h2><strong>Sec 2 G1 ITE Visit</strong></h2>
<p>Our Sec 2 G1 CCKSians spent an exciting Monday at ITE College West to
learn more about its course offerings. Secondary Two is a crucial year
as our CCKSians will have to decide on their subject combinations for Secondary
Three. Visiting ITE and learning more about the courses will help them
think about what they aspire to do and make informed decisions on what
subjects they wish to pursue in 2026.</p>
<p>The experiential nature of the visit also allowed our CCKSians to "ride"
the train as part of ITE's Rapid Transit Engineering course, check out
the School of Hospitality's fully equipped kitchen as part of its Culinary
Arts course and hear first-hand from ITE staff and students about the exciting
curriculum on offer at ITE College West.</p>
