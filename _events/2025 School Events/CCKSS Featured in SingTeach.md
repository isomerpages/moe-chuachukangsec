<p>Choa Chu Kang Secondary School (CCKSS) is proud to be featured twice in <em>SingTeach</em> Issue

commitment to nurturing lifelong learners and fostering a dynamic, knowledge-building
community. <a href="https://singteach.nie.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SingTeach_Issue-94.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Read the full issue here.</a>

<p>“Over the past few years, I’ve witnessed a quiet but powerful transformation
sweep through the classrooms and corridors of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School.
It is not just in the lessons being taught—but in how we think about learning,
how we engage with ideas, and most importantly, how we treat one another
as a community of learners. This shift began when we embraced the philosophy
of Knowledge Building—a belief that knowledge is best constructed socially
and authentically, with every learner taking co-ownership of the problems,
processes and practices. And as we did so, something profound started to
happen.” -<strong><em> Mr Timothy Cheng, Principal, Chua Chu Kang Secondary School (CCKSS)</em></strong>
