<h2><strong>Visit by Shinkamigoto Board of Education, Japan</strong></h2>
<p>We were honoured to host a delegation of students and staff from the Shinkamigoto
Board of Education, Japan, for a two-day immersive visit on 4 and 5 August,
filled with meaningful cultural exchange, hands-on learning, and shared
experiences.</p>
<p>On 4 August, the day began with a Pongal Pot painting session, introducing
our guests to the traditions and artistry behind this significant harvest
festival. Students expressed their creativity while learning about the
cultural roots of Pongal in a fun and engaging way.</p>
<p>The visit continued with our Science @ Work programmes. Highlights included
orchid hybridisation, where participants learned about the science behind
creating new orchid varieties. They also took part in a pressed orchid
flower craft activity, allowing students to transform natural specimens
into beautiful keepsakes. The group also visited our herb and spice garden,
where they enjoyed the aroma and textures of local plants used in cooking
and traditional remedies. This sensory experience was accompanied by a
refreshing tasting of roselle and blue pea tea, paired with soft, fragrant
pandan cake—a delightful way to end the day's activities.</p>
<p>In the Mobile Robotics Lab, students explored the world of innovation
through a 3D printing activity, where they were introduced to design thinking
and left with a customised luggage tag as a souvenir Another highlight
was the Virtual Reality in Education showcase. Students had the chance
to explore immersive learning environments and saw how VR can enhance understanding
across various subjects. They had lots of fun using the VR sets to challenge
each other to games and took the chance to "visit" places that they had
never been to before.</p>
<p>On 5 August, we embarked on a learning journey to Chinatown and Kampong
Glam, giving our guests a firsthand look at Singapore’s multicultural heritage.
In Chinatown, students explored traditional shophouses, temples, and local
crafts. At Kampong Glam, they learned about Malay-Muslim culture, visited
the iconic Sultan Mosque, and explored the vibrant streets rich in history
and modern street art.</p>
<p>These two days were filled with warmth, curiosity, and collaboration.
The visit not only fostered deeper understanding between our communities
but also created lasting memories and friendships. We thank the Shinkamigoto
Board of Education for visiting us and look forward to continued exchanges
in the future.</p>
