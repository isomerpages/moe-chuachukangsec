<h2><strong>CCKSS Global Connect Programme Sharing 2025</strong></h2>
<p>Our CCKSians started the day with an exciting sharing by our Secondary
4 students, Anggun and Kumuthini from 4A and Alfred and Aulia from 4C.
These four CCKSians represented their trip mates from the 2024 CCKSS Global
Connect Programme trips to China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia in a
sharing of their learning experiences during their visits last year.</p>
<p>Our Sec 1 to 3 CCKSians were eagerly listening, anticipating the day they
too would board the airplanes to take them to these exciting destinations!
Anggun, Kumuthini, Alfred and Aulia were excited to share their experiences
and their enthusiastic presentations on the cultural experiences, school
visits, values-in-action opportunities and local food were rich and informative.</p>
<p>We would like to invite interested Secondary 3 CCKSians to discuss their
interest in the programme with their parents/guardians through the online
form sent via Parent Gateway. Hope to see you on board our programme soon!</p>
