<h2><strong>Discovery Week</strong></h2>
<p>At Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, the Discovery programme kicked off
with excitement! The objective of Discovery Week is to encourage individuals
to explore their own interests, talents, and aspirations while also fostering
connections with peers. Our CCKSians engaged in activities that revealed
not only their personal strengths but also those of their friends. Additionally,
the programme aimed to equip everyone with new knowledge and skill whilst
promoting personal growth and collaborative learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the first day, our Sec 1 CCKSians delved into urban farming, learning
to plant edibles and cultivate mushrooms, while also creating coffee scrub
and eco-enzymes. Meanwhile, our Sec 2 CCKSians enjoyed kayaking and bowling,
and our Sec 3 CCKSians challenged themselves in an outdoor team-building
event at Fort Canning. Lastly, our Sec 4 CCKSians glided into fun with
inline skating, making it a memorable day for all!</p>
<p>On the second day of Discovery Week, our Sec 1 CCKSians immersed themselves
in the vibrant rhythms of Indian and Brazilian percussion, while also gaining
crucial first aid skills. Meanwhile, our Sec 2 CCKSians ventured into the
Sustainable World of Tomorrow at BCA, exploring eco-innovations. Our Sec
3 CCKSians engaged in an enlightening Industry Learning Journey paired
with an ECG talk, and our Sec 4 CCKSians enjoyed the thrill of inline skating,
embracing a blend of learning and fun.</p>
