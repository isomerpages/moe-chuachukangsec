<h1><strong>SG60: CCKSS Celebrates National Day!</strong></h1>
<p>On 8 August, Chua Chu Kang Secondary School came together to mark a truly
special milestone — Singapore’s 60th birthday. The SG60 celebration was
a vibrant blend of tradition, unity, and joy, making it a memorable occasion
for the entire school community.</p>
<p>The morning began with the National Day Observance Ceremony, led by the
school’s uniformed groups. Their crisp salutes, precise marching, and disciplined
bearing set a tone of dignity and pride for the day ahead.</p>
<p>Each level then embarked on activities designed to deepen their connection
to the nation. Our Secondary 1 CCKSians participated in an engaging lesson
on nation-building, exploring the resilience and values that shaped Singapore’s
journey. Our Secondary 3 CCKSians reached a milestone in their citizenship
journey with the NRIC Presentation Ceremony, a proud moment marking their
growing responsibilities. Our Secondary 4 CCKSians attended a National
Service engagement talk, gaining insights into their upcoming roles as
young adults.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Secondary 2 cohort gathered in the parade square to form
a striking “SG60” formation — a living tribute to the nation’s diamond
jubilee. This display became even more spectacular when the Secondary 1
cohort joined them, creating a united human formation that symbolised the
school’s shared pride in Singapore’s achievements.</p>
<p>The celebrations culminated in the school hall, where students and staff
gathered for a spirited concert. The performances reflected both the talent
and the passion of the CCKSS community, and the atmosphere grew increasingly
charged as the event drew to a close. With flags in hand and voices raised,
the school delivered a rousing finale, wishing Singapore a magnificent
60th birthday.</p>
<p>The day was a powerful reminder of how far the nation has come — and of
the unity, resilience, and pride that will carry it forward.</p>
