<h2><strong>Secondary Two Theatre Experience</strong></h2>
<p>The ELL Deptâ€™s Theatre Experience Programme provided an enriching opportunity
for the Secondary 2 CCKsians. On May 19th and 20th, they attended a captivating
performance of "Perfecting Pratas, Don't Know Don't Care" at the KC Arts
Centre. The students witnessed their classroom text come to life on stage,
enriching their understanding and appreciation of theatre. This authentic
experience fostered a deeper connection to the art form, leaving lasting
impressions on all.</p>
