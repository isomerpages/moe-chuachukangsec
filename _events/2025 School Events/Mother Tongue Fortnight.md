<h2><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong></h2>
<p>Mother Tongue Fortnight was a feast for the senses! Students indulged
in a variety of ethnic treats, from nostalgic Singaporean childhood biscuits
to traditional delights like <em>kueh talam</em>, rainbow<em> kueh lapis</em>,
and <em>muah chee</em>. Beyond food, they engaged in class-based cultural
activities during Mother Tongue lessons and embarked on enriching learning
journeys. These experiences allowed them to deepen their appreciation for
their heritage, connecting with traditions in meaningful ways. We were
also fortunate to have the support of our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089627506407" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Parent Support Group</a> who
came down in full force to create themed booths serving food and showcasing
traditional handicrafts! The fortnight was a vibrant celebration of language
and culture, bringing students closer to their roots while creating unforgettable
memories.</p>
