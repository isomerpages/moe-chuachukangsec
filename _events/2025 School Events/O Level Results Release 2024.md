<h1><strong>O Level Results Release 2024</strong></h1>
<p>There was an air of excitement tinged with apprehension as our Sec 4 Express
and 5 Normal Academic CCKSians gathered in the Hall on a rainy afternoon
to receive their GCE O Level results on 10 January 2025. As Mr Cheng began
his presentation and shared that the cohort had done well in their subjects
and had outperformed their seniors in some subjects, the Class of 2024
yelled for joy as their year of resilience and hard work paid off.</p>
<p>As we celebrated the achievements of our CCKSians, we also took stock
of the resilient CCKSians who persevered through challenges and successfully
graduated from the school.</p>
<p>Before long, the moment everyone was waiting for arrived and as they received
their result slips from their form teachers, our CCKSians leapt for joy
or rushed over to celebrate with parents and family members who came down
to give them moral support.</p>
<p>We wish all our CCKSians the best of luck in their future endeavours as
they leave the nest and move on to post-secondary education!</p>
