<h2><strong>Chinese New Year at CCKSS!</strong></h2>
<p>Chinese New Year is always a very festive occasion at CCKSS, and this
year was no exception! Teachers celebrated with their classes over <em>Lohei</em> at
the Hall, with all students tossing the ingredients and sharing well wishes
for the coming year. Afterwards, students were treated to a contortionist
performance, as well as an umbrella magic show, interspersed with a quiz
section, videos from our Parents Support Group and a <em>Wushu</em> performance
from our students. It all culminated with a lion dance and ended on a high
with a sing-along from our teachers. Happy Chinese New Year!</p>
