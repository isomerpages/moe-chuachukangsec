<h2><strong>Start Right Programme</strong></h2>
<p>The new school year began with excitement and anticipation as the whole
school cohort settled in through CCKSSâ€™ signature Start Right Programme.
Starting right in the year ensures the right tone is set for a successful
year ahead. In CCKSS, we believe that Starting Right means starting well
academically and having the right attitude for school. HODs and YHs take
the time to brief students on academic and classroom routines that would
help them make the most out of their classroom lessons. Positive character
development is also emphasised through talks by the Student Management
Team on behavioural expectations that would create a positive school environment.</p>
<p>As such, Start Right provides a conducive environment which acclimatises
CCKSians to academic and character routines whilst providing time and space
for teacher-student bonding. It is something that CCKSians look forward
to when they start a new academic year. The Start Right Week also allows
our Principal, Mr Cheng, to set the school tone right and for key personnel
to share important updates and instil academic and behavioural routines.</p>
<p>Start Right also organises a series of bonding activities to foster better
relationships so that rapport is easily built. The games also give students
a chance to reconnect with their teachers and friends and for newly formed
Sec 1 and Sec 3 classes to get to know each other better.</p>
<p>Our Sec 1 CCKSians enjoyed fun orientation activities organised by the
Student Council where they got to know each other better and enjoyed a
sumptuous breakfast with their form teachers. At the end of the programme,
it was heartening to see the Sec 1s making new friends and enjoying themselves
with their peers.</p>

<p>Our Sec 2 CCKSians had breakfast with their form teachers and enjoyed
an afternoon of kite flying where they worked on kites with their classmates
and teachers and took advantage of the lovely weather to get their kites
up in the sky!</p>

<p>Our Sec 3 CCKSians, who formed new classes this year spent some time bonding
with one another and getting to know their classmates better. Through a
series of bonding games in the Indoor Sports Hall, they were soon excitedly
working together with their new classmates to solve puzzles. Their energy
was infectious and soon the whole hall was abuzz with their laughter and
good cheer!</p>

<p>Our Sec 4 and 5 CCKSians, who have major examinations to handle got off
to a good start and spent the day on a sandcastle building challenge to
bond as well as to get their minds relaxed and ready for a good start to
the final academic lap! From their smiles and sun-kissed faces, they really
had a great time!</p>

<p>These activities helped ease CCKSians back into school routines and by
Term 1 Week 1, they were eagerly ready for lessons to begin.</p>
