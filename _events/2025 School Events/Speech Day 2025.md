<h1><strong>Speech Day 2025 "Together We Excel"</strong></h1>
<p>On 11 April, we celebrated our school’s Speech Day—an annual milestone
of pride and achievement. What made this year especially meaningful was
the incredible spirit of collaboration and ownership displayed by everyone
involved.
<br>
<br>From the impressive coordination among uniformed groups to the powerful
combined martial arts segment and seamless performance transitions — every
detail reflected a shared commitment to excellence. Even CCAs with SYF
commitments gave their all, embodying our belief: when we take pride in
our work, excellence follows.</p>
<p>As a CCKSian family we proudly affirmed and celebrated the achievements
of our staff and students, applauding one another's success! We were also
treated to entertaining performances by Concert Band, Modern Dance, Wushu
and Taekwondo. Our Uniformed Groups also led a welcome party to welcome
the Guest of Honour, PSG Chairperson, Mdm Devi Noorjahan.</p>
<p>Speech Day was also a time where we fondly remembered key events like
community outreach engagements and overseas twinning programmes that have
helped create a positive environment for CCKSians to thrive and contribute.</p>
<p>We also paid tribute to our partners who help us be part of the "Village"
that mould our CCKSians to develop future-ready mindsets and empathetic
hearts who act responsibly. Finally, a big shout out to all our CCKSians
who worked tirelessly behind the scenes to make today's Speech Day a big
success!</p>
