<h2><strong>Tamil Language Unit Language Hub Activity</strong></h2>
<p>As part of our MTL 'Language Hub Activity', our TL students participated
in an Indian martial art (Silambattam) learning session this afternoon.
Alongside CCKSS Sec 2 students, our TL Centre Sec 1 and 2 students learned
Silambam rotating skills from expert instructors. Notably, some Sec 2 students
picked up the basics quickly and demonstrated impressive proficiency. This
session allowed students to explore the fundamentals of Indian martial
arts, enriching their cultural experience.</p>

<h2><strong>Motivation Talk by SINDA</strong></h2>
<p>Our CCKSS and TLC graduating TL students benefited from a motivational
talk from SINDA on managing exam stress, which will be particularly helpful
as they prepare for their upcoming O-level exams. Developing resilience
in our CCKSians is important in helping them as they also prepare to embark
on their post secondary journeys! All the best for your exams!</p>
