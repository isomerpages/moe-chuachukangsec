<h2><strong>Outward Bound Singapore</strong></h2>
<p>Our Sec 3 CCKSians completed 2 batches of Outward Bound Singapore over
the first two weeks of May. Initially shy and uncertain as they met their
camp mates from differnt schools across Singapore, they soon rose to the
challenge and before long, they were trading contact details and working
together to handle various campcraft tasks.</p>
<p>Outward Bound brought our CCKSians out of their comfort zones and gave
them the opportunity to challenge themselves as they did the high elements,
water confidence courses, kayaking and hiked the great outdoors! When their
Year Head, Ms Janna and our school leaders visited them, they were full
of smiles and excited to be doing the activities with their new friends!</p>
<p>As Batch 1 returned and Batch 2 left for their turn at Outward Bound,
one thing was certain, our CCKSians are defintely resilient and ready for
any challenge thrown their way. Of course, if given a choice, they would
do Outward Bound again in a heartbeat!</p>
