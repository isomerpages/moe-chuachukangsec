<h2><strong>Knowledge Building Networked Learning Community Session</strong></h2>
<p>11 CCKSS educators attended the Knowledge Building Networked Learning
Community Session today where they gained valuable insights into new educational
technologies development (including AI-powered tools), innovative pedagogies,
and meaningful teaching and learning strategies. Mr Melvin Chan, our Lead
Teacher (History), co-facilitated the discussion segment. They are now
ready to leverage on AI in designing deeper collaborative inquiry, generating
transformative &amp; adaptive assessment, &amp; building strong epistemic
agency for CCKSians.</p>
