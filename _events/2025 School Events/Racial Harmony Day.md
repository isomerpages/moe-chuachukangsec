<h1><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong></h1>
<p>On Monday 21 July, CCKSS came alive with vibrant traditional outfits,
a fun-packed concert, and delicious food booths from our dear Parent Support
Group parents who came in full force to dish out tasty treats to our hungry
CCKSians! As predicted, the queues were long and the food was quickly snapped
up by staff and CCKSians alike! We were also privileged to have with us
Dr Ian Hunter, founder of The Writers' Toolbox - a favourite with our CCKsians
as they work using the online tool to hone their writing skills! As teachers
and CCKsians passed each other in the corridors, it felt like a colourful
fashion show of beautiful traditional costumes! It’s a beautiful reminder
that our diversity makes us stronger. Let’s continue to learn from one
another and celebrate the unity that makes Singapore home!</p>
