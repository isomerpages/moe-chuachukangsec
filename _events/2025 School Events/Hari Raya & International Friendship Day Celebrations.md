<h1><strong>Hari Raya &amp; International Friendship Day Celebrations</strong></h1>
<p>Our combined Hari Raya and International Friendship Day concert was a
meaningful celebration of cultural diversity, friendship, and unity. Through
vibrant performances, our students and teachers beautifully showcased Malay
traditions during Hari Raya, alongside festive celebrations from different
cultures around the world.
<br>
<br>More than just a concert, it was a heartfelt reminder of the importance
of embracing diversity and fostering a harmonious, inclusive community.
Letâ€™s continue to shine the light of friendship in all we do.</p>
