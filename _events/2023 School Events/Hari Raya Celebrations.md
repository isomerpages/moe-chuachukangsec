In the beginning of May, the Malay Language unit, in collaboration with the SWB committee organized a heart-shaped ketupat weaving session for staff and students. It was an activity for the whole school to participate and be a part of the celebration. It was a great bonding time for staff and students, basking in the festive mood. After completing the cards,  students are then encouraged to write well-wishes for their peers and teachers.

On 5th May 2023, the Malay Language Unit together with a group of enthusiastic teachers from various department put together our first Hari Raya Concert as a merged school. In preparation for this concert, the ML Unit equipped students from the Secondary 3 cohort with essential skills such as dance and Dikir Barat during Mother Tongue Fortnight to prepare them as participants for this concert. The teachers also invited members of the Parent Support Group (PSG), and staff to be part of the celebrations. The D &amp; T Unit helped with making the stand for the “obor” (torch) used for the VVIP walkway. The staff, students and parents awed our audiences with wonderful performances.
