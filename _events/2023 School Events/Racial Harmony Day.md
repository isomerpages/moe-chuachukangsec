##### Racial Harmony Day – Be Inspired! Be Involved!

Racial Harmony Day was celebrated in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School on 28 July 2023 with the tagline, “Be Inspired! Be Involved!” It was a very festive atmosphere with many students coming to school in their ethnic attire and even teachers as well. It was an opportunity for students to learn about one another’s cultures and take photos together.
In addition, it was also an opportunity to learn more about racial harmony and its importance to Singapore. Not only did students have a CCE lesson on how to face up to everyday bias and prejudice, on 28 July, there was also a presentation during morning assembly to help students understand that racial harmony in Singapore should not be taken for granted. 
The programme culminated with the Multicultural Mosaic Activity in both campuses, with a mosaic of post-it notes from students about what racial harmony meant for them. It was a meaningful programme and a memorable day for one and all!
