The Founders’ Memorial is presenting a new exhibition titled Semangat yang Baru: Forging a New Singapore Spirit, which brings to life the new spirit of dynamism and courage captured in our National Anthem, in the early years when the leaders and people of Singapore rallied together to build our fledging nation. One of the stories explored in the exhibition is the struggle people faced when campaigning for women’s rights, most notably in the form of the “one-man-one wife” law and family planning. As such, CCKSS’s team, led by Elijah Aris Yuen @ Elijah Aris Lim Jie, Sandy Foo We Shan, and Rene Aaliyah Binte Masrudin from class 4/4 2022, who interviewed Mdm Tan Ai Kheng during the Student Archivist Project (SAP) 2022, provided a much needed personal perspective on how the “stop-at-2” campaign impacted women’s lives. The students attended an online workshop on oral interview and writing skills before doing the oral interview video filming, which was filmed by professionals.
