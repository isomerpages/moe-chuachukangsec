Students had the opportunity to learn in a different setting during Discovery Week.

Secondary One students experienced outdoor learning during a 3D2N camp at campus 2. They had fun in the sun playing games, cooking their own meals and water rafting at Sentosa.

Secondary Two students learnt teamwork through community drumming and learnt how to plan a ViA project. They also had a fun time participating in archery.

The Secondary Three students tried their hand at dragonboating, bowling and songwriting. They also had some fun learning journeys to museums as well as industrial visits.

Our graduating cohort learnt about building their portfolios, preparing for interviews and also had talks conducted by various polytechnics on the Early Admission Exercise.

All students also had time set aside to play games with each other and their teachers.

It was overall a fun time spent doing things outside the normal curriculum.
We want MORE!!!!!!!
