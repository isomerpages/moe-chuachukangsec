Chua Chu Kang Secondary School had its first cross-country run on 24th May 2023. It was a whole school affair, with all the students from Secondary 1 to Secondary 5 participating. Our students and even staff – and yes, including our very own Principal, Mr Timothy Cheng – participated in the 3.4 km race over paved and unpaved terrain along the Pang Sua Park Connector. The day culminated in the prize-giving ceremony in the hall for the winners for the different levels, with the cheers truly reflecting the CCKSS spirit to celebrate achievement through adversity!
