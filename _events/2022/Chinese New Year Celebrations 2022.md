# **Chinese New Year Celebrations 2022**

It was 31st January 2022, the eve of Chinese New Year. The school was in a celebratory mood eager to usher in the year of the Tiger. Prior to the event, students had decorated the corridors in a sea of red. Red is the main colour for the festival, as red is believed to be an auspicious colour, denoting prosperity and energy whilst being able to ward off evil spirits and negativity.

The students were in unison, determined to win the CNY Class Decoration Competition. They hung red lanterns and self-made firecrackers from recycled ‘Ang Paos’, and pasted red couplets and hand-drawn tiger cut-outs representing this year’s Chinese zodiac on the railings, doors and windows of their classrooms. The mood was set.
