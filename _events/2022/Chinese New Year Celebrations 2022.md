# **Chinese New Year Celebrations 2022**

It was 31st January 2022, the eve of Chinese New Year. The school was in a celebratory mood eager to usher in the year of the Tiger. Prior to the event, students had decorated the corridors in a sea of red. Red is the main colour for the festival, as red is believed to be an auspicious colour, denoting prosperity and energy whilst being able to ward off evil spirits and negativity.

The students were in unison, determined to win the CNY Class Decoration Competition. They hung red lanterns and self-made firecrackers from recycled ‘Ang Paos’, and pasted red couplets and hand-drawn tiger cut-outs representing this year’s Chinese zodiac on the railings, doors and windows of their classrooms. The mood was set.

Immediately after morning assembly, the students in their respective classes sat down eagerly and dabbled in the handicraft-making session. The school was silent as students watched the video-tutorial intently and pitted their skills against each other in the hope that their handicraft would be good enough to be chosen to represent their class and clinch the top prize!

Much to everyone’s surprise, in sauntered our mascot, a bright orange tiger. The silence was broken! The classrooms were abuzz with incessant chatter as curious students tried to guess the identity of the masked stranger while clamouring to catch a piece of candy thrown their way. The big reveal - it was none other than our teacher, Mr Yu Yoong Kheong!

 Similar to last year, students were given the opportunity to watch their schoolmates perform while adhering to COVID-19 safety measures. It was a virtual concert, live streamed in class for everyone to enjoy. The concert started with a bang as our principal, Mdm Adel Ong, stepped onto the stage and sounded the ‘Gong’. Our emcees in their lovely cheongsams, Karen Lor Khai Mun (4/8), S. A. Taraasshri (3/8), Rethinam Renosha (3/7) and Iman Atrisya Iwani (3/5), took over the stage, eloquently engaging the audience and unfolding the day’s programme.

First up, the ‘Diabolo’, a Chinese yoyo performance, by our sec 2 and 3 boys. We were entertained as the boys displayed their skillful tricks and mastery at balancing the yoyo. Next, our Wushu performers strode onto stage. We were riveted to our seats as we watched their intricate sword display and energetic acrobatic moves. Not to be outdone, our girls from the Dance and Movement Club gave an alluring performance.   
  
Soon, beautiful music emanated from the Foyer. It was the Chinese Orchestra serenading us with traditional music. Another surprise, a solo-dance number by our teacher, Ms Zhang Xuedi. There was no denying her elegance as she sashayed on stage in perfect harmony with her beautiful fan.    
  
To evoke the CNY vibe, our Parents Support Group (PSG) formed a virtual choir singing CNY songs. Following the PSG segment, the winners of the CNY class decoration competition and handicraft competition were announced. Class 2/2,  2/4, 3/3, 3/7, 4/4, and 4/8 won the Class Decoration Competition while Irdina Qaisara (2/2), Jean Capuno (2/6), Lim Tze Hyeng (3/5), James Teo (3/8), Mandy (4/5) and  Xie Jiayi (4/6) won the Handicraft Competition. Thunderous applause and loud cheers could be heard reverberating throughout the school. It was a proud moment for the students.  
  
The day ended on a high note with teachers giving out red packets filled with chocolate coins to students from their form class.  The CNY Concert Organising Committee had certainly outdone themselves. This was a celebration that will forever be etched in our minds!
