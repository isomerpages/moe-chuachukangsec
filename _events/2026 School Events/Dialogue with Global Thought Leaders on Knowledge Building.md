<h2><strong>CCKSS Engages in Strategic Dialogue with Global Thought Leaders on Knowledge Building</strong></h2>
<p>We were honoured to be one of only two schools in Singapore selected to
engage in a professional dialogue with four esteemed members of the Distinguished
International Advisory Panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Professor Chris Chapman</strong>, Chair of Educational Policy
and Practice, University of Glasgow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Professor Adam Lefstein</strong>, Morton L. Mandel Director, Seymour
Fox School of Education, Hebrew University of Jerusalem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dr Carol Tan</strong>, Senior Lecturer, National Institute of
Education, Nanyang Technological University</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dr Justin Lee</strong>, Senior Research Fellow, Institute of Policy
Studies, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This engagement centred on CCKSS’s Knowledge-Building (KB) pedagogical
practices and programmes, our robust partnership with the National Institute
of Education (NIE), and our leadership in advancing Knowledge Building
through the National Knowledge Building Community Networked Learning (KBCNL)
initiative.</p>
<p>The session was further enriched by the participation of CCKSS (TWSS)
alumnus, Isyraf, who reflected on his Knowledge-Building experiences as
a student. He shared how a strong Knowledge-Building culture was intentionally
cultivated through form class teachership under the guidance of Mr Melvin
Chan. As Isyraf noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Through our form class teachership, Mr Chan created a KB culture where
we were encouraged to question, build on one another’s ideas, listen deeply,
and take responsibility for our collective learning. These practices have
stayed with me beyond school—helping me communicate more effectively with
my loved ones, collaborate more productively with my team, and facilitate
discussions in my work as an SCDF firefighter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through such alumni reflections, CCKSS affirms the enduring impact of
Knowledge Building in shaping learners’ dispositions, relationships, and
professional practices beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our esteemed panelists for their
invaluable insights and to our dedicated educators and partners who continue
to champion innovative pedagogies. As we look ahead, CCKSS remains steadfast
in its commitment to cultivating a culture of inquiry, collaboration, and
lifelong learning.</p>
