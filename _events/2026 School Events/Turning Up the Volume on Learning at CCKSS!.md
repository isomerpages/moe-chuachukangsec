<h2><strong>Turning Up the Volume on Learning at CCKSS!</strong></h2>
<p>Our school recently hosted media professionals from Ria 89.7FM and Capital
95.8 as part of the school’s ongoing efforts to provide authentic learning
experiences that prepare our CCKSians for a rapidly evolving world. The
engagement focused on strengthening CCKSians’ communication competencies
while broadening their awareness of career pathways within the media industry.</p>
<p>Through thoughtfully curated sharing sessions, our CCKSians gained practical
insights into effective public speaking, presentation techniques, and audience
engagement. The interactive nature of the programme encouraged active participation,
allowing our CCKSians to build confidence and develop the clarity needed
to communicate ideas with purpose and impact.</p>
<p>For the Capital 95.8 segment, we specially invited a media reporter and
a radio DJ to share their professional journeys and workplace experiences.
Their candid perspectives offered students a deeper understanding of industry
expectations and the transferable skills required to thrive in communication-driven
professions.</p>
<p>A highlight of the engagement was the return of our alumna Wu Wei Ying
吴韦莹, now an established media professional, who connected meaningfully
with the Secondary 4 &amp; 5 CCKSians through her reflections on transitioning
from student to media professional. Her journey underscored the enduring
value of a CCKSS education and served as a powerful reminder that resilience,
passion, and strong communication skills can enable students to realise
their aspirations.</p>
<p>The session with DJs from Ria 89.7FM placed a strong emphasis on presentation
skills, equipping our CCKSians with practical strategies to organise their
thoughts, articulate ideas clearly, and respond confidently to questions.
These competencies are particularly valuable in strengthening our CCKSians’
overall communication capabilities — a critical life skill that will support
their academic journeys, future careers, and ability to engage meaningfully
in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
<p>Beyond skill acquisition, the session nurtured CCKSians’ self-expression
and strengthened their readiness to engage confidently with diverse audiences.
By interacting directly with industry practitioners, our CCKSians were
empowered not only to speak effectively, but also to influence, collaborate,
and lead.</p>
<p>This engagement reflects CCKSS’s commitment to holistic education — developing
future-ready learners equipped with the competencies, adaptability, and
confidence to navigate an increasingly complex landscape. Through strategic
partnerships and the continued involvement of supportive alumni, the school
remains dedicated to creating meaningful platforms that connect classroom
learning with real-world relevance.</p>
<p>When CCKSians find their voice, they discover their power — a belief that
continues to guide CCKSS in shaping confident communicators and future-ready
individuals.</p>
