<h2><strong>First Day of School 2026: <em>Growing Together, Thriving Together</em></strong><em> </em></h2>
<p>The new school year at CCKSS began on a joyful and meaningful note as
we warmly welcomed our CCKSians back on campus for the first day of school.
It marked the start of a new chapter filled with learning, friendships,
and fresh opportunities.</p>
<p>To set the tone for the year ahead, our Principal, Mr Cheng, addressed
the school community, encouraging all CCKSians to put in their best effort
as they learn and grow together. His message highlighted the importance
of perseverance, positive attitudes, and striving to <em>Grow and Thrive</em> throughout
the year.</p>
<p>The morning continued with a special breakfast shared between students
and their form teachers. This simple yet meaningful gesture provided a
relaxed environment for students to reconnect, settle into the new school
year, and strengthen bonds within their classes, fostering a strong sense
of belonging from the very first day.</p>
<p>Following breakfast, each level engaged in fun and interactive activities
with their form teachers and classmates. These activities were thoughtfully
designed to build rapport, encourage teamwork, and cultivate the right
mindset to <strong>“Start Right” </strong>in 2026.</p>
<p>As we launch our school theme, <strong>“Growing Together, Thriving Together,”</strong> we
are reminded that every CCKSian’s journey is supported by strong relationships,
care, and collaboration. The smiles, conversations, and positive energy
seen across the campus today truly set the tone for a year where our CCKSians
can learn, grow, and succeed together.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for Monday’s programme as we continue to kick-start the school
year with purpose and excitement.</p>
<p>Here’s to a wonderful year ahead!</p>
