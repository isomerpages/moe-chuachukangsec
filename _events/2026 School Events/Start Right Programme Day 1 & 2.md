<h2><strong>Start Right 2026: <em>Growing Together, Thriving Together</em></strong></h2>
<p>The new school year at CCKSS began on a joyful and meaningful note as
we warmly welcomed our CCKSians back on campus for the Start Right Programme.
Spanning two purposeful days, the programme marked the beginning of a new
chapter filled with learning, friendships, and fresh opportunities.</p>
<p>To set the tone for the year ahead, our Principal, Mr Cheng, addressed
the school community, encouraging all CCKSians to put in their best effort
as they learn and grow together. His message underscored the importance
of perseverance, positive attitudes, and striving to <em>Grow and Thrive</em> throughout
the year.</p>
<p>Day 1 began with a special breakfast shared between CCKSians and their
form teachers. This simple yet meaningful gesture provided a relaxed environment
for CCKSians to reconnect, settle into the new school year, and strengthen
bonds within their classes, fostering a strong sense of belonging from
the very first day. Following breakfast, CCKSians engaged in fun and interactive
class-based activities thoughtfully designed to build rapport, encourage
teamwork, and cultivate the right mindset to “Start Right” in 2026.</p>
<p>Day 2 continued the momentum with level-specific programmes tailored to
the developmental needs of our CCKSians. Our Secondary 1 CCKSians participated
in orientation and class bonding activities, helping them ease into secondary
school life while forging new friendships and building confidence in their
new environment. Secondary 2 and 3 CCKSians took part in team-building
challenges and cyberwellness workshops, where they learned the importance
of collaboration, resilience, and making responsible choices in the digital
world.</p>
<p>For our graduating cohorts, the Secondary 4 and 5 CCKSians embarked on
the “Shifty Sands” experience. Through building sand fortresses and engaging
in carefully designed challenges, students learned powerful lessons about
adaptability and resilience. Just as a fortress in the sand is shaped by
shifting conditions, they experienced how challenges may arise, plans may
need to change, and strength is built through teamwork, effort, and perseverance.
The activity served as a meaningful reminder that even when things do not
go as planned, we can adapt, rebuild, and grow stronger together.</p>
<p>As Mr Cheng launched our school theme, <strong>“Growing Together, Thriving Together,”</strong> we
are reminded that every CCKSian’s journey is supported by strong relationships,
care, and collaboration. The smiles, conversations, and positive energy
seen across the campus over these two days truly set the tone for a year
where our CCKSians can learn, grow, and succeed together.</p>
<p>Here’s to a wonderful year ahead as we continue to journey forward with
purpose and excitement!</p>
