<p>On 19th February, CCKSians were treated to a delightful drama performance
by Morph Theatre Company during morning assembly. Titled ‘Crow Boy’, the
drama explored our school’s Term 1 values of care and respect. CCKSians
also took to the stage and joined the improvised skits, expressing their
insightful views on these values. This captivating event served not only
to entertain but also to underscore the significance of care and respect
within our school community.</p>
<p>Synopsis of Show:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A shy Japanese boy having difficulty adjusting to school is misjudged
by his classmates. Chibi has been an outcast since that frightening first
day of school when he hid under the schoolhouse. Afraid of the teacher
and unable to make any friends, Chibi passes his free time alone — alone
at study time, alone at playtime, always a forlorn little tag-along. But
when Mr. Isobe arrives, the teacher sees things in Chibi that no one else
has ever noticed... A well-loved tale, Crow Boy is a tender story of a
neglected outsider and the power he gains from being accepted.”</p>
