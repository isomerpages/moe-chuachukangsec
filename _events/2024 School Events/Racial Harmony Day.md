<p>Racial Harmony is a priority for CCKSS. The Racial Harmony Day celebration
was the culmination of a whole week of activities. Students were able to
view informative exhibition panels about different cultures and enjoyed
themed booth activities from students of the Active Citizenry Committee,
showcasing costumes, wedding traditions and even games and medicine from
different cultures.</p>
<p>On 22nd July, CCKSS came alive with students and staff in colorful ethnic
costumes for Racial Harmony Day. During assembly, there was a bingo quiz
to test our studentsâ€™ understanding of other cultures and Mr Christopher
Gordon from <a href="http://OnePeople.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">OnePeople.sg</a> engaged
our school cohort with a talk about the impact of casual racism. Mdm Hartati
gave the closing address and highlighted class 2C1 for showcasing and teaching
traditional games to residents at Chua Chu Kang Community Centre over the
weekend. A photo booth added to the festive spirit, allowing everyone to
capture the day's memorable moments. Overall, it was a heartwarming event
that showcased the unity and strength of our multicultural society.</p>
