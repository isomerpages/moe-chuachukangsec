<p>This year, our Hari Raya concert was held on 15 April 2024 during morning
assembly. And what a programme it was! It featured Kompang and Silat performances
which drew cheers from the crowd. Iris Nurzafyra and Danish Anaqi from
3C wowed the audience with their rendition of “Suasana Hari Raya”, followed
by a Malay Dance and Dikir Barat performance. The highlight of the show
was the Kain Sambing wearing contest, where our students tried to follow
the instructions on how to wear the Malay clothing item. This drew laughter
and applause from the crowd in appreciation of their valiant efforts! Mr
Jamil sang “Lemak Manis” with teachers and PSG members dancing in accompaniment.
The concert ended on a high with a dance performance by teachers and students.
All in all, it was a showcase giving a deep insight into the diverse aspects
of Malay culture and arts.
