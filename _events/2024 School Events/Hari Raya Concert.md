<p>This year, our Hari Raya concert was held on 15 April 2024 during morning
assembly. And what a programme it was! It featured <em>Kompang</em> and <em>Silat</em> performances
which drew cheers from the crowd. Iris Nurzafyra and Danish Anaqi from
3C wowed the audience with their rendition of “<em>Suasana Hari Raya</em>”,
followed by a Malay Dance and <em>Dikir Barat </em>performance. The highlight
of the show was the <em>Kain Sambing</em> wearing contest, where our students
tried to follow the instructions on how to wear the <em>Kain Samping</em>.
This drew laughter and applause from the crowd in appreciation of their
valiant efforts! Mr Jamil sang “<em>Lemak Manis</em>” with teachers and
PSG members dancing in accompaniment. The concert ended on a high with
a dance performance by teachers and students. All in all, it was a showcase
giving a deep insight into the diverse aspects of Malay culture and arts.
