<p>We are the Champions!</p>
<p>With the slogan "We are the champions!" driving their determination, our
school’s hockey teams excelled in the National School Games 'C' Division
league finals. The Girls’ team secured a hard-fought win over a combined
Queensway Secondary School/Singapore Chinese Girls' School 2 to 1, emerging
as Champion in League 2 while the Boys’ team came in second in League 2
to Woodlands Ring Secondary School. Both teams’ success is a testament
to their dedication and perseverance, with the countless hours of training
twice a week since the beginning of the year. Congratulations to our ‘C’
Division Hockey Boys and Girls! You have made us proud!</p>
