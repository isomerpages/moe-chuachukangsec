<p>After going through weighted assessments, it was finally time for Discovery
Week! Our lower secondary CCKsians, not only played games in class, they
also went outside of the class for experiential learning. Our Secondary
One students went for the Mathematics in the Garden @ Science Centre programme,
while the Secondary Two students, went to Bukit Batok Civil Service Club
to learn bowling from professional instructors. The Secondary three students,
in turn, went to Kallang for Laser Tag and Bubble Soccer games or to Suntec
for games at the Superpark. Apart from class bonding, there were also opportunities
to develop 21st century skills, as the Secondary two and three cohorts
underwent the Student Leadership programme to develop their leadership
skills. The Secondary three students also experienced industry learning
journeys to various places ranging from hotels and restaurants to a media
company. The week concluded with students taking stock of the semester
gone by and celebrating their shared achievements over the two terms.</p>
