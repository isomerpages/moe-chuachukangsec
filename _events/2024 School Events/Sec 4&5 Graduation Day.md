<p>27 September was a bittersweet day for our Secondary four and five students,
as it marked their official graduation. The day began with a walk down
memory lane. A photo montage and videos captured their journey from Secondary
one to Secondary four/five, reminding them of the challenges during the
COVID-19 pandemic, and the many joyful moments of school life. Alongside
messages and performances meant to encourage the students, they also received
gifts from the Parents Support Group. The celebration ended on a high note,
with a photo booth for students to capture moments with their teachers
and friends.</p>
