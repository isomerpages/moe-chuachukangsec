<p>On 31<sup>st</sup> July, Chua Chu Kang Secondary School was proud to host
students and teachers from Shinkamigoto Education Board in Nagasaki, Japan.
Our student councillors were paired as buddies with the Japanese students
to help them during the dayâ€™s activities. They got off to a great start
as they bonded over playing local traditional games like capteh, pick up
sticks and five stones.</p>
<p>For the Japanese students, it was a very enriching experience too. They
explored hydroponics and pressed orchids into cards. They engaged in artistic
cultural activities such as tie-dyeing bags, and painting Pongal pots.
Our guests went for a walk around the Teck Whye and Chua Chu Kang neighbourhood
and even had the chance to experience virtual reality in education. It
was truly a memorable day for them indeed!</p>
