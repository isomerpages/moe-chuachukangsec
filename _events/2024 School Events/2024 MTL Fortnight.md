<p>In line with MOE’s efforts to promote the learning and appreciation of
Mother Tongue Languages and cultures, CCKSS Mother Tongue Department curated
a series of activities. The activities revolved around the event theme
entitled “EAT·DRINK·PLAY·JOY”. The event was staged between 6th February
to 20th February 2024, to encourage the use of Mother Tongue languages
and to expose students to the various cultures in Singapore.</p>
<p>The highlight of the series of activities is the Mother Tongue Fortnight
Carnival held on the 6th of February. Members of the school were treated
to an array of traditional snacks in the school. These snacks include traditional
Malay Kuehs, Putu Piring, Dragon Beard Candy, Kacang Puteh and Mua Chee.
Culturally oriented crafts and games booths were also available onsite
to offer students a chance to experience activities that belonged to the
bygone generations. Students had the opportunity to create their own souvenirs
such as Jawi name labels, assembling fragrance sachets and piece up three-dimensional
models of traditional buildings. Students had an opportunity to play traditional
games such as Aadu Puli Aattam, Batu Seremban, Capteh, Congkak and Five
stones with their teachers and friends. The student curriculum was enriched
with in-house cultural experiential programmes, such as Pongal making,
pot drawing, fabric dyeing, and Jawi card making, to enhance their cultural
knowledge.</p>
