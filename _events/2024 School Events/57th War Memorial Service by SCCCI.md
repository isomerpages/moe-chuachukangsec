<p>The 57th War Memorial Service was held at the Civilian War Memorial on
15th February 2024. Organised by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (SCCCI), the event is held annually to commemorate the sacrifice
of civilians during the Japanese occupation of Singapore.</p>
<p>The event saw a memorial service that brought together families of the
victims, members of the SCCCI, representatives from the military, leaders
of the different religious groups of Singapore as well as students from
various schools paying tribute to the victims of war.</p>
<p>The four pillars of the Civilian War Memorial symbolises the shared suffering
of the main ethnic groups and the perished. The service served a timely
reminder to our CCKsians that our peace cannot be taken for granted and
every one of us can and must play a part towards Total Defence.</p>
