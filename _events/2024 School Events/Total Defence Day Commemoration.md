<p>This year marks Singaporeâ€™s 40th year of Total Defence. As a small state,
Singapore relies on a total defence approach to rally Singaporeans for
a whole-of-society response to threats to our sovereignty, security and
success. In order to further help our students to better understand the
importance of Total Defence in overcoming real-world challenges, on the
15th of February, we embarked as a school on the Food Resilience Experience.
Our students went through CCE lessons on food disruption and were provided
with a RTE (Ready-to-eat) meal supplied by the Singapore Food Agency.</p>
