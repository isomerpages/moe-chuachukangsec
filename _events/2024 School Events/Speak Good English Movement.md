<p>The Speak Good English Movement (SGEM), spearheaded by English teachers,
was an engaging initiative designed to cultivate a culture of linguistic
excellence among students. This biweekly event took place at the school
hall every alternate Thursday morning, offering students an opportunity
to immerse themselves in the beauty of the English language. Teachers curated
captivating skits that showcase both incorrect and correct English usage,
enlisting enthusiastic students to bring these scenarios to life onstage.
In addition to the entertaining performances, interactive quizzes were
integrated to reinforce understanding and test students' comprehension.
Through this dynamic and interactive approach, SGEM fostered a deeper appreciation
for the intricacies of language while empowering students to communicate
effectively in English.</p>
