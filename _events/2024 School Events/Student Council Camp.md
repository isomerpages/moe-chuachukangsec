<p>Student Council Camp was a dynamic blend of bonding, leadership training
and spirited games. Rooted in our philosophy that everyone can lead, the
day began with lessons on leadership principles. Through experiential learning
activities such as the Amazing Race and telematches, Student Councillors
explored teamwork, communication and group decision-making. Empowerment
was key as each member embraced their potential to lead in diverse contexts.
Moreover, reflection and evaluation sessions allowed them to refine our
skills and strategies. The camp fostered a strong sense of camaraderie
among Student Councillors, reinforcing the belief that leadership is about
collaboration and empowerment. It was a day when learning and bonding intertwined
seamlessly.</p>
