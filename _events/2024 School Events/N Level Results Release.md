<h1><strong>N Level Results Release</strong></h1>
<p>There was an air of excitement tinged with apprehension as our Sec 4NA
and 4NT CCKSians gathered to receive their GCE N Level results on 16 December
2024. As Mr Cheng began his presentation, the apprehension was slowly lifted
as the cohort cheered when some of their subjects showed better results
than the previous yearâ€™s.</p>
<p>As we celebrated the achievements of our CCKSians, we also took stock
of the resilient CCKSians who persevered through challenges and successfully
graduated from Sec 4NA and Sec 4NT.</p>
<p>Soon, the moment everyone was waiting for arrived and as they received
their result slips from their form teachers, our CCKSians leapt for joy
or rushed over to celebrate with parents and family members who came down
to give them moral support.</p>
<p>We wish all our CCKSians the best of luck in their future endeavours as
they leave the nest and move on to post-secondary education!</p>
