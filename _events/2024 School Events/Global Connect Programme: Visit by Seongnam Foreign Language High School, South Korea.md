<p><strong><em>Hosting of Staff and Students from Seongnam Foreign Language High School, South Korea</em></strong>
</p>
<p>As part of a cluster collaboration with W6 Cluster schools, CCKSS hosted
30 students and 2 teachers from Seongnam Foreign Language High School in
South Korea. Our CCKSians excitedly welcomed their counterparts from South
Korea and bonded over breakfast, swapping stories about how school life
is like for a typical fifteen-year-old in each country.</p>
<p>Following breakfast, each group went through two of the school’s signature
programmes – Science @ Work and Virtual Reality in Education. Very soon,
squeals of excitement were coming from the Virtex Room where our friends
and their buddies were exploring the exciting world of virtual reality
and taking part in quizzes organised by our Ms Izzati and Ms Lim, who hosted
the segment on Virtual Reality in Education.</p>
<p>After an exciting virtual journey, a trip to the Urban Farm on Level 6
and a hands-on session in orchid hybridisation had everyone in awe of the
wonders of Science @ Work where Mrs Wong and Mdm Normala guided our friends
and their buddies in the intricate art of orchid hybridisation and orchid
crafts. After a fruitful session where everyone emerged with a lovely orchid
craft bookmark, it was sadly time to say good bye as souvenirs were exchanged
and social media handles were exchanged.</p>
<p>In all, it was a fruitful experience for our CCKSians as they were able
to hone their global and cross-cultural literacy skills and form new bonds
with their friends from South Korea.</p>
