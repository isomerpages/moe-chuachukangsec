<p>The Pongal Celebration was held on 22nd January, with PSG members as our special guests. The celebrations kicked off with Mr Timothy Cheng, our Principal, lighting up the traditional oil lamp.</p><p>After Mr Chengâ€™s opening address, there was an introduction of Pongal and its significance. This was followed by different dances performed by the Venus Arts Academy, namely the <strong><em>Kollatam</em></strong>, <strong><em>Oyilattam</em></strong> and <strong><em>Poi Kaal Kuthirai</em></strong> which were eye-opening. Our students also performed dance numbers that elicited numerous cheers and applause. This was indeed a great way to learn about Pongal and our cultural diversity.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="389" width="640" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRn31_BHWR0olJZChnPJm_DN8_J7OpUn2EpWIbBUqupqZaC4j8IecdLGL-ZukW9GQ/embed?start=true&amp;loop=true&amp;delayms=3000"></iframe></div><p></p>
