<p>2nd July was an important occasion for NCC as they celebrated NCC Day.
The NCC Unit was on the stage to lead the school when singing the National
Anthem and saying the Pledge. This was followed by the Unit reciting the
NCC Pledge. This year, there was a video message from Brigadier General
Lam Shiu Tong, the Chairman of the NCC Council, who emphasised the importance
of Total Defence to prepare for crisis and disruption and outlined the
variety of NCC programmes to nurture NCC Cadetsâ€™ holistic growth and character
development. Mr Cheng, our Principal, was then welcomed on stage to give
out the 2023 Unit Recognition Award to the CCKSS NCC Unit. In addition,
Outstanding Contribution Awards were given to Master Sergeant Wong Qi Zhi
and Staff Sergeant Kulandaisamy Nitish Xavier in recognition of their excellent
service to the Unit.</p>
