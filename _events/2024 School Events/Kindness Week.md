<p>The program began with an engaging sharing session led by Student Councillors,
highlighted by a poignant "Job Shadowing: Expectation vs Reality" video
illustrating their daily challenges. Following this, a heartfelt appreciation
segment dedicated to our non-teaching staff commenced, where each staff
member was warmly presented with a Gerbera flower as a token of our profound
gratitude. The audience erupted in enthusiastic cheers as the staff members
were honored on stage. A brief yet impactful presentation on "Acts of Kindness
and Their Impact on Happiness" underscored the significance of kindness
in nurturing a supportive and empathetic community.</p>
