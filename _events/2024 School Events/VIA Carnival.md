<p>Our students embraced Values-in-Action (VIA) with enthusiasm across different
levels, presenting their projects during morning assembly. Secondary 1
students focused on practical contributions like umbrella-sharing, promoting
toilet cleanliness and creating posters to encourage orderly queuing at
the canteen. Secondary 3 students took on more community-focused efforts,
from engaging with children at a kindergarten through games and activities
to organising a beach cleanup. Student Councillors had their own VIA where
they promoted sustainable living through corridor farming and participated
in the KidsREAD program with the National Library Board to boost literacy
in young children. Through these initiatives, students not only honed leadership
and collaboration skills but also deepened their sense of responsibility
and community service.</p>
