<p>The National Day celebration featured a spectacular parade, with our uniformed
group cadets and band members displaying unity and pride through energetic
performances. Bursting with excitement, students crafted festive birthday
greetings for Singapore and captivated the audience with lively community
songs. The student emcees also enthralled the audience with a “How Singaporean
are You?” quiz and presentation. Our Vice-Principals, Madam Hartati and
Madam Lee, kicked off the “Keep the Balls in the Air” game, during which
the audience had to keep bouncing large colourful balls throughout the
songs, displaying resilience in doing so. Secondary One Students enjoyed
a lovely picnic at Jurong Lake Gardens, Secondary Two Students were intrigued
by talks about the Orang Laut, Secondary Three Students enjoyed an informative
talk on National Service by alumnus, LTA Koh Fu Ping and our Secondary
Four classes had their picnic at Sembawang Park, while the Secondary Five
Students, explored the lush Singapore Botanic Gardens. Together as one,
everyone celebrated the national spirit of Singapore!</p>
