<p>Teachers’ Day at CCKSS!</p>
<p>This year’s Teachers’ Day was especially memorable as it marked the first
time the merged school celebrated together in one venue. And what a special
occasion it was! After the class celebrations in their respective classrooms,
it was time for the concert. Our Dance CCA members drew gasps of admiration
with their stunning performance. Some Secondary three students formed a
band to perform songs, with the added surprise of Mr Chai joining in on
the guitar! There was also a hugely entertaining and engaging inter-level
quiz competition, where the Secondary three students emerged victorious.
The day culminated with a skit and dance performed by teachers, receiving
widespread applause. It was truly a wonderful day to celebrate the dedication
and hard work of our teachers throughout the year.</p>
