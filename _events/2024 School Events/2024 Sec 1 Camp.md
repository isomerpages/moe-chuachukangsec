<p>Embarking on a fantastic four-day, three-night adventure, Camp Sec 1 was
the absolute highlight of our time at Changi Coast Outdoor Adventure Learning
Centre. From January 29th to February 1st, we spirited CCKSians dived headfirst
into an incredible experience, embracing values that make us who we are
â€“ Respect, Resilience, and Care. Nature wasn't just our backdrop; it was
our super cool classroom. We tackled high and low elements, whipped up
delicious outdoor feasts, and went on awesome coastal explorations. Every
moment was stitched into the tapestry of our personal growth. MOE's awesome
program made us pals for life, revealed our hidden strengths, and gave
us a deep love for our environment. This wasn't just a camp; it was our
epic journey toward becoming thoughtful, tough, and caring individuals,
attuned to the challenges of the future.</p>
