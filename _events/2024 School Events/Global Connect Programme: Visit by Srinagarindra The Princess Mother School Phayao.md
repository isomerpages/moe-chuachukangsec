<p>We were very excited to welcome our friends from Srinagarindra The Princess
Mother School Phayao (SWPY), Chiang Rai, Thailand to our school once again.
After getting to know each other in 2023, our CCKSians visited SWPY in
November and met up with their buddies once again, having a great time
bonding over cultural activities like drumming, dance and Muay Thai. The
were also treated to a once-in-a-lifetime experience of releasing Lanna
lanterns into the night skies of Phayao.</p>
<p>Having received such a warm welcome, our CCKSians were eager to see their
friends again and planned a cultural-themed welcome ceremony incorporating
Malay Kompang and Chinese Wushu to usher in our visitors. After breakfast,
our CCKSians and their friends got busy with cultural appreciation activities
where they learnt how to make Pongal pot art, tie-died fabric bags and
bookmarks using Jawi calligraphy. After lunch, our friends had a good time
trying their hand at different CCA activities including concert band, modern
dance, netball and basketball. One highlight of the afternoon programme
was the planting of a sapling to commemorate the deep friendship between
the two schools as well as to promote sustainability by contributing to
the One Million Tree movement.</p>
<p>On the second day of their visit, our friends enjoyed a sampling of signature
programmes such as learning with virtual reality and orchid hybridisation.
After a sumptuous lunch and a heartwarming farewell segment, everyone boarded
a bus to Gardens by the Bay where our CCKSians and their friends enjoyed
a visit to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and OCBC Skywalk. After bidding
each other farewell, there were promises of a reunion in November when
CCKSians will visit their friends as part of the schoolâ€™s Global Connect
Programme.</p>
