<p>As part of an EL lesson on Sustainability, 4M &amp; 4N set up a Thrift
Bazaar to drive home the message of ‘Little Steps to a more Sustainable
Lifestyle’. Seizing on the spring-cleaning season prior to Chinese New
Year, the students announced their project during morning assembly and
urged students and staff to donate clothes that are in good condition to
the Thrift Bazaar. They also did research on sustainability in Singapore,
prepared posters for the event and went from class to class to promote
the Thrift Bazaar.</p>
<p>There was enthusiastic support from staff and students and donations came
pouring in. 4M and 4N students spent hours sorting and arranging the clothes
for the Thrift Bazaar. For EBS students in 4N, they got to practise what
they learned about marketing and also picked up skills in merchandise display.</p>
<p>The student population thronged the Thrift Bazaar on 29 Feb, eagerly picking
out the clothes they wanted. How much did they have to pay for the clothes
they chose? Nothing. All that 4M &amp; 4N students asked for was a pledge
from them – one thing they will do for a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
<p>Let's make a difference, one pledge at a time:</p>
<p>“I will not waste any food.”</p>
<p>“I will bring my own water bottle and not buy bottled water.”</p>
<p>“I will bring reusable bag instead of buying plastic bags from supermarkets.”</p>
<p>“I will go meatless once a week.”</p>
<p>“I will only buy things that I really need to prevent food waste.”</p>
