<p>The “Blind Date with a Book” event, which took place at our school library
during Valentine’s Week, was a riveting literary experience. Students eagerly
participated in the initiative, seeking the coveted golden ticket concealed
within one of the books each day, which entitles them to a delectable chocolate
bundle. Furthermore, the library was adorned with monuments representing
teachers’ favourite books, igniting a love for reading in students. To
top it off, our reader ambassadors guided their classmates through the
array of online activities such as writing a “Letter to the Author”, creating
a “Comic Strip (Go Beyond the Book)” and “Headliners”. Reading has never
been so electrifying!</p>
