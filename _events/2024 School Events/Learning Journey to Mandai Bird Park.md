<p>Our Teachers embarked on an exciting learning journey to Mandai Bird Park,
immersing themselves in innovative educational programmes and resources.
The visit featured engaging sustainability talks and guided tours, highlighting
the parkâ€™s groundbreaking research and conservation work. Teachers were
captivated by how they could incorporate these insights into their teaching,
inspiring students to become environmental champions. This dynamic journey
not only deepened their knowledge but also fuelled their passion for wildlife
conservation and sustainable solutions. Returning with fresh ideas and
renewed enthusiasm, teachers are now equipped to lead their students in
championing a greener future.</p>
