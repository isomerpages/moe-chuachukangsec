The Mother Tongue Department (Tamil Unit) held its annual school based Pongal celebrations on 2 February as part of the Mother Tongue Fortnight activities.  Participants were treated to a lovely traditional dance performance by CCK-ians as well as students from the school’s Tamil Centre. In addition, colourful display booths showcasing traditional Indian games, jewelry and information about Pongal were set up so that visitors could learn more about and appreciate the Tamil culture. Our principal, Mr Cheng, lit the ceremonial lamp and declared the celebration open.

It was also very heartwarming to see our colleagues from other races borrowing traditional clothing from their Indian colleagues and coming down to celebrate Pongal. Marveling at the beautiful and colourful rangoli and Pongal pots display, colleagues pointed out similarities in their own cultures regarding harvest and farming. It was certainly very informative! As we celebrate our diversity and embrace our multicultural heritage, we can only continue to be stronger together!

Today’s celebration also marked the end of an exciting suite of activities organised for the CCKSSians and students from the school’s Tamil Centre. During the month of January, Secondary 1 to 5 students participated in a learning journey to Little India, painted pongal ponts, learnt to play traditional games and instruments and even learnt the art of making the Pongal overflow! From the happy faces, it looks like a good harvest is in store!
