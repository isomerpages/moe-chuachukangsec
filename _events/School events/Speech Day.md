We carried out our first Speech Day as a merged school on 4 August 2023. It was a key milestone in the year as Mr Cheng unveiled the school’s new Vision, Mission and Values. Guests were also given a preview of the school’s new school song, conceptualised by our CCKSians and teachers. The event began with a guard of honour contingent who welcomed our guest of honour, Mr Michael Chew, Vice Chairperson of the School Advisory Committee. As we celebrated the achievements of our students and staff, we were treated to an exciting performance by our Guitar Ensemble and Dance students, who enthralled the audience with their talent. The former school leaders of Chua Chu Kang Secondary and Teck Whye Secondary, Mdm Adel Ong and Mr N Sivarajan, also came back to present the Outstanding CCKSian of 2022 awards to Subash Chandra Bose Sweta and Hailey Ng Yen Teng. As the audience rose to sing the new school song, we certainly felt pride as CCKSians!
