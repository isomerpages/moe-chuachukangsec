We commemorated National Day with our very first parade! The sun was shining, the UGs marched to the beats of our concert band and CCKSians soaked in the atmosphere! Well done UGs and Concert Band for setting the standard for many more parades to come! Shout out too to the AV crew for their help in ensuring the parade ran smoothly! Happy National Day!

Our Sec 1s and graduating classes were blessed with good weather as they set off for their cohort picnics to Jurong Lake Gardens (Sec 1s), Botanic Gardens (Sec 4s) and Marina Barrage (Sec 5s)! From the photos it was clear they had lots of fun! We were even treated to an F-16 fly past!

Our Sec 2s and 3s enjoyed a fun-filled activity where they had to work together to pass a giant inflatable ball across the Hall before a heartfelt sing-a-long of our favourite National Day songs. It was certainly a great first National Day celebration for our CCKSians!

Our CCKSians also served the community by helping out at the Chua Chu Kang 58th National Day Observance Ceremony and Open House Carnival 2023. They were happy to serve and from everyone’s smiles, it looks like they had a good time too! Till Singapore’s next birthday!
