To usher in the year of the Rabbit, the annual Chinese New Year celebrations kicked off with Lo Hei on a grand scale. Staff and students gathered in the school hall, and tossed salad ingredients and crackers as words of prosperity were read out by the emcees. Chorus of voices could be heard at every corner of the hall! After getting their stomachs filled, students returned to their classroom for activities such as making clay sculptures for the lower secondary classes and hamper wrapping for the upper secondary classes. These hampers were later distributed to the Fei Yue Family Service Centre.

Later in the morning, a resounding crash echoed around the school as our Principal, Mr Cheng, struck a gong to signal the commencement of the concert. In collaboration with the Art Club, the school leaders, Mr Cheng, Mdm Hartati, Mdm Lee and Mr Ang completed a piece of Chinese which reads “May all your dreams come true”. 

The audience was given a real feast for the eyes with performances from the Choir, Dance and Wushu. Two students, Liew Rui Xiang (3A) and Zhuo Chaofan (3A) also put up a breathtaking display of juggling and tossing a diabolo in the air using a string. The concert concluded with the launching of confetti poppers. Everyone was in high spirits!
