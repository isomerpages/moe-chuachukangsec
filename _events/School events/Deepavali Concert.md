As the drum beats reached a resounding crescendo, two lovely peacock ladies danced to the rhythm, ushering our school leaders and guests to the school hall to mark the start of the Deepavali Concert festivities. Our Principal, Mr Cheng, lit the Deepavali lamp with the Tamil Unit and an exciting line-up of dances and songs thrilled our CCKSians who enthusiastically cheered the performers. We were serenaded by Mr Benjamin and Ms Izzati who sang a Tamil song like pop stars and enjoyed dance items by our Parents Support Group, teachers and fellow CCKSians. We were also lucky enough to enjoy an energetic dance performance by dancers from the Nrityodaya Indian Cultural Centre from Johor Bahru. Arranged by Mr Steven Joseph (PBM), Chairman of the Chua Chu Kang CC IAEC, the dancers wowed the crowd with their colourful costumes and mesmerising dance moves. Looking at the Chinese New Year and Hari Raya concerts, the Mother Tongue Department definitely knows how to get CCKSians in a festive mood!
