#### The History Times: Living in the Interwar Period #### 

**Presentation by CCKSians to the Knowledge Building International Community**

Historians are curators who capture, connect and construct stories of the past. Over the past year, students from Clementi Town Secondary School and Chua Chu Kang Secondary School came together to build knowledge on the big idea of the Interwar Period. After engaging in a series of collaborative activities and rigorous performance tasks, the students then worked together in conceptualizing, designing, and creating a set of history newsletters related to the theme. 

On 14th April 2023, the Knowledge Building Networked Learning Community brought together over 50 teachers, students, researchers and experts all over the world to learn, inquire and deepen their collective understanding on the interwar period. Co-presenting with their peers from CTSS, their joint concurrent sharing sessions got the participants to be fully engaged, enriched, and empowered with regards to their level of historical literacy, consciousness, and discourse.  

Building upon these meaningful experiences, the school is now looking into enhancing this cross-school collaboration with the possibility of working with overseas institution(s)/school(s).
