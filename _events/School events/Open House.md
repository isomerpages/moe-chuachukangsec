### CHUA CHU KANG SECONDARY SCHOOL OPEN HOUSE 2023
#### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQs)


**1.CUT-OFF POINTS**

**1.1	What is the school’s indicative PSLE Score range?**

Based on students posted to Sec 1 in 2023:
	

|   | G3 | G2 | G1|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ------|
| Achievement Level (AL)<br>(Source: MOE SchoolFinder) | 15 - 21     | 21 - 25     | 26 - 28 |

	
**Remarks:**
Meeting the indicative cut-off point (COP) does not guarantee admission to the school. The current year’s PSLE Score ranges may vary, depending on the demand pattern and cohort size.

**2. SCHOOL HOURS**

**2.1 What are the school’s start and end times?**
	
* Morning flag-raising will begin at 0800. Students are encouraged to be punctual for school and report earlier before 0750 to do quiet reading or self-study to prepare for the school day. Lessons will generally end between 2.30pm to 3.30pm.
	
 
**3. NUMBER OF SEC 1 CLASSES FOR 2024**

**3.1	How many classes are there for Secondary 1 in 2024?**
	
* In 2023, we had 6 Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) classes. They were mixed classes of students taking subjects at G3, G2 and G1 levels. We are planning for a similar number in 2024 but there could be slight variations annually based on intake.

**4.	HIGHER MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES (HMTL) – FOR STUDENTS TAKING G3 MTL ONLY**

**4.1	Does CCKSS offer Higher MT languages for CL, ML &amp; TL?**

* CCKSS offers HMTL to students in the G3 course of study who are competent in their Mother Tongue Language. The objective of the HMTL course is to develop students’ fluency in all their chosen Mother Tongue Languages.
* HCL, HML &amp; HTL classes are offered **within** the school. Students do not need to travel to other centres to take HMTL.
* Prospective students must demonstrate their competence in the language before they can be offered HMTL. 

**4.2	Other Important Information:**

* HMTL lessons are conducted in school. Students will attend 4 hours of HMTL lessons per week – 3 hours during normal curriculum time and 1 hour after school.
* HMTL students will sit for the GCE O-Level MTL Exam at the end of Secondary 3, and the GCE O-Level HMTL Exam at the end of Secondary 4.
* As HMTL is a more demanding subject, compared to G3 MTL, students offering HMTL must put in consistent effort to do well. They are not allowed to drop the subject and switch to G3 MTL at any point in time.
* If a student uses HMT as his/her L1, he/she is not allowed to use MT in the computation of R5/R4, as MOE only allows students to use **ONE MT grade** at any one time, and not both. If he/she uses EL as his L1, he/she can choose either the HMT or MT grade for the computation of R5/R4, whichever is better.
* Hindi classes will be held within the school premises for the year 2024. However, this arrangement is reviewed on a yearly basis.  

**5.	SUBJECT ALLOCATION**

**5.1	How many subjects are offered at Sec 3?**
	
* The maximum number of subjects offered for 2023 was 8. 
* The subjects offered for Sec 3 Express students in 2023 are English Language, Mother Tongue, Higher Mother Tongue, Mathematics, Additional Mathematics, Principles of Accounts, Pure Science (Chemistry, Physics, Biology), Combined Science (Physics/Chemistry or Chemistry/Biology), Humanities  (Core History or Core Geography and Social Studies with Elective History or Elective Geography or Elective Literature) and Coursework Subjects (Art, Design &amp; Technology or Nutrition &amp; Food Science).

* Students in the NA or NT course of study who perform exceptionally well in English Language, Mother Tongue, Mathematics, Sciences or Humanities may be offered the opportunity to take the subject at a higher academic level.

**6. FULL SUBJECT BASED BANDING**

* As part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students, our Lower Secondary students are in mixed form classes offering subjects at more or less demanding levels, calibrated to balance between greater customization of learning while ensuring they benefit from a broad-based education focused on developing strong fundamentals and stretching students to their fullest potential. 
* There are six Common Curriculum subjects that students attend together in their mixed form classes, i.e. Art, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Design and Technology (D&amp;T), Food and Consumer Education (FCE), Music, and Physical Education (PE).
* While the learning outcomes will be common for all students, teachers will differentiate their teaching to meet the learning needs of different learner profiles to ensure that they continue to be sufficiently supported and challenged in their learning. This will allow students to learn at a suitable pace while ensuring that a high level of quality and rigour in teaching is maintained.

	*"Students who opt for Core History must take up Combined Humanities (Social Studies and Elective Geography or Elective Literature); students who opt for Core Geography must take up Combined Humanities (Social Studies and Elective History or Elective Literature)"*
		
* All secondary school students can offer **English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science** at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students' PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject. This provision will continue under Full SBB.

* Students in schools that are implementing Full SBB will also be able to offer **Humanities subjects** (Geography, History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary Two. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary One.

	![](/images/Events/School%20Events/2023/OpenHouse_2023_Picture2.png)

* Under Full SBB, the GCE N and O Level examinations will be replaced with the new Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations. This will apply for the 2024 Secondary One cohort. From 2027, the national certification will reflect the subject level at which each subject is taken. 


**7.	PERSONAL LEARNING DEVICE (PLD)**

**7.1	Will my child get a Personal Learning Device next year?**

* As part of the National Digital Literacy Programme, every secondary student would have their own Personal Learning Device (PLD) at Secondary 1. Parents will need to opt in to the programme so that the school can make a bulk purchase. Students can pay for the device through their Edusave accounts. For students from lower-income households, further subsidies are provided.
* The PLD that is used by Chua Chu Kang Secondary students currently is the Chromebook. The new cohort of Secondary 1 students will continue to purchase the Chromebook too. Complemented by enhanced internet connectivity in schools, PLDs will better support teaching and learning and develop students' digital literacies.

**9.	SPECIAL PROGRAMMES**

**9.1 What special programmes are offered?**

**Academic**

**Applied Learning Programme (ALP): Technology in Sustainability Programme (TSP)**

* The study of the role of Technology in Sustainability enables our students to gain practical understanding of this domain, and to design technological solutions to real world sustainability challenges. The programme also aims to develop 21st Century Competencies such as critical and inventive thinking skills. 
* Under this programme, students challenge themselves to come up with creative and innovative solutions as they learn ways to promote sustainability and explore technological solutions to sustainability challenges. The school also partners the Singapore Science Centre and industrial partners such as Silicon Labs for extended learning opportunities for students who exhibit a keen interest in this area. 

**Orchid Hybridisation Programme (Biology)**
* The Orchid Hybridisation Programme is a series of workshops where students learn about the physiology and anatomy of an orchid plant and the process of orchid hybridisation. This provides a unique real-world context for learning relevant topics in the Pure Biology and Science (Biology) syllabi. In recent years, the school has expanded its programme and developed the Design and Research Space for Orchid Hybridisation where students can carry out the hybridisation process under laboratory conditions and try their hands at creating new orchid hybrids.

**Immersive Classroom (Virtual Reality)**
* To make lessons more engaging, Virtual Reality is employed to allow students to be immersed in various environments, helping them connect with the content and issues in various subjects for example, in English, the Humanities, as well as hone skills, for example, in Physical Education and Art. Students are able to go on virtual ‘field trips’ and ‘visit’ cities in other parts of the world. 
* As part of their subject projects, students are taught how to take photos and redesign them using CoSpaces Edu, a computer application that allows students to do simple 3D-modelling and animation with basic coding and explore them in VR. This allows them to hone their ICT and presentation skills and enhances the interactivity of the lessons, allowing greater connection and collaboration. 

**Co-Curricular**

**Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Community Youth Leadership**
* Our LLP is Community Youth Leadership. The aim of the programme is to develop our students with the necessary life-skills to be responsible and contributing citizens of the future. A CCKSian makes a consistent effort to develop his/her personal attributes such as self-reliance, perseverance, and a sense of responsibility to self, society, and nation. 
* All CCKSians attend courses based on the Student Leadership Challenge with a specific focus for each level.  In addition, training is customised for specific student leader groups such as the Student Councillors, Class Committee and CCA Leaders.
* CCKSians are encouraged to apply their learning through their CCAs and community service where they will work in teams to serve others, and to demonstrate their leadership potential. Adopting the Design Thinking Framework for Values-in-Action programme enables students to develop empathy for others &amp; create solutions to meet their needs. CCKSians are also given opportunities to initiate service- learning projects in school and in the community. 
* To expose students to the needs of the global community, CCKSians will also attend the Global Connect Overseas Programme which include cultural immersion and community service.

**10.	TRANSPORTATION &amp; TRAFFIC**

**10.1 What is the traffic condition like outside school in the morning?**

* We are situated along a belt of schools. The schools along this belt have staggered start times and as such traffic is not a major problem.
* We do strongly encourage students to start their journey to school earlier, so that they arrive at school punctually and are in a better frame of mind for the school day ahead.

**10.2 Where can I drop my child off in the morning if I am driving?**

* Parents can drop their child off along at the designated drop off point inside the school, after the school gate.

**11.	GENERAL DISCIPLINE AND SCHOOL TONE**

**11.1 How is the discipline of the students in school like?**

* The school discipline tone is positive, with established systems and strong support from the Student Development Team.
* Year Heads are appointed to oversee the well-being and holistic development of the students in their respective levels with support from the Student Management Committee.

**11.2 Is the environment in the school conducive for studying?**

* We constantly encourage and motivate our students to give their best and to maximize their potential.
* We are also mindful that a good study environment is essential for teaching and learning to take place. Our teachers too are mindful of this and work towards cultivating a strong learning culture here in CCKSS.
* Conducive study spaces can be found in the library and students may make use of study tables and chairs located outside the Computer Labs.

**11.3 Are handphones allowed in the school?**

* Students learn well when there is order, discipline and minimal distraction. It is important that all CCKSians learn to be responsible and discerning users of technology. We would strongly advise parents, if they wish their children to bring a mobile phone to school, to purchase for your child only a simple mobile phone for communication purposes. This is to minimize distraction and replacement costs in the case of loss or damage.  
* In addition to the CCE and Cyber Wellness curriculum, our school has in place the following rules and policies to ensure responsible use of mobile devices in school.
* Students will keep their mobile phones/electronic devices in assigned lockers at the start of the day. Mobile phones/electronic devices can only be used after the end of the curriculum hours. 
* Should parents need to contact their child, or in the case of an emergency, they may call the school office. For non-emergency cases, they should SMS their child and leave a message for him/her to return a call as soon as he/she reads the message after school dismissal.

**12.	TEACHERS**

**12.1 How are the teaching staff like?**

* Our teachers are caring and committed to bring out the best in our students.  We believe in our students’ abilities and work closely with them to help them realise their full potential. 
* There is also a strong culture of learning, sharing and collaboration among our teachers and this translates into better teaching and learning practices for our students.

**13.	COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WITH PARENTS**
