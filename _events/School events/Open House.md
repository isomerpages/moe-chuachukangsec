### CHUA CHU KANG SECONDARY SCHOOL OPEN HOUSE 2023
#### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQs)


**1.CUT-OFF POINTS**

**1.1	What is the school’s indicative PSLE Score range?**

Based on students posted to Sec 1 in 2023:
	

|   | G3 | G2 | G1|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ------|
| Achievement Level (AL)<br>(Source: MOE SchoolFinder) | 15 - 21     | 21 - 25     | 26 - 28 |

	
**Remarks:**
Meeting the indicative cut-off point (COP) does not guarantee admission to the school. The current year’s PSLE Score ranges may vary, depending on the demand pattern and cohort size.

**2. SCHOOL HOURS**

**2.1 What are the school’s start and end times?**
	
* Morning flag-raising will begin at 0800. Students are encouraged to be punctual for school and report earlier before 0750 to do quiet reading or self-study to prepare for the school day. Lessons will generally end between 2.30pm to 3.30pm.
	
 
**3. NUMBER OF SEC 1 CLASSES FOR 2024**

**3.1	How many classes are there for Secondary 1 in 2024?**
	
* In 2023, we had 6 Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) classes. They were mixed classes of students taking subjects at G3, G2 and G1 levels. We are planning for a similar number in 2024 but there could be slight variations annually based on intake.

**4.	HIGHER MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES (HMTL) – FOR STUDENTS TAKING G3 MTL ONLY**

**4.1	Does CCKSS offer Higher MT languages for CL, ML &amp; TL?**

* CCKSS offers HMTL to students in the G3 course of study who are competent in their Mother Tongue Language. The objective of the HMTL course is to develop students’ fluency in all their chosen Mother Tongue Languages.
* HCL, HML &amp; HTL classes are offered **within** the school. Students do not need to travel to other centres to take HMTL.
* Prospective students must demonstrate their competence in the language before they can be offered HMTL. 

**4.2	Other Important Information:**

* HMTL lessons are conducted in school. Students will attend 4 hours of HMTL lessons per week – 3 hours during normal curriculum time and 1 hour after school.
* HMTL students will sit for the GCE O-Level MTL Exam at the end of Secondary 3, and the GCE O-Level HMTL Exam at the end of Secondary 4.
* As HMTL is a more demanding subject, compared to G3 MTL, students offering HMTL must put in consistent effort to do well. They are not allowed to drop the subject and switch to G3 MTL at any point in time.
* If a student uses HMT as his/her L1, he/she is not allowed to use MT in the computation of R5/R4, as MOE only allows students to use **ONE MT grade** at any one time, and not both. If he/she uses EL as his L1, he/she can choose either the HMT or MT grade for the computation of R5/R4, whichever is better.
* Hindi classes will be held within the school premises for the year 2024. However, this arrangement is reviewed on a yearly basis.  

**5.	SUBJECT ALLOCATION**

**5.1	How many subjects are offered at Sec 3?**
	
* The maximum number of subjects offered for 2023 was 8. 
* The subjects offered for Sec 3 Express students in 2023 are English Language, Mother Tongue, Higher Mother Tongue, Mathematics, Additional Mathematics, Principles of Accounts, Pure Science (Chemistry, Physics, Biology), Combined Science (Physics/Chemistry or Chemistry/Biology), Humanities  (Core History or Core Geography and Social Studies with Elective History or Elective Geography or Elective Literature) and Coursework Subjects (Art, Design &amp; Technology or Nutrition &amp; Food Science).
* The subjects offered at Sec 3NA in 2023 were English Language, Mother Tongue, Mathematics, Additional Mathematics, Principles of Accounts and Combined Sciences (Physics/Chemistry or Chemistry/Biology), Humanities (Core History or Core Geography and Social Studies (with Elective Geography/Elective History) and Coursework Subjects (Art, Design &amp; Technology and Nutrition &amp; Food Science).
* The subjects offered at Sec 3NT in 2023 were English Language, Basic Mother Tongue, Mathematics (NT), Science (NT), CPA (Computer Applications), Social Studies (non-examinable) and one other elective subject (Elements of Business Skills, Mobile Robotics, Art or Design &amp; Technology).
* The allocation of subject combinations will depend on the students’ eligibility for respective options based on their academic performance and choice as well as the availability of school resources.
* Students in the NA or NT course of study who perform exceptionally well in English Language, Mother Tongue, Mathematics, Sciences or Humanities may be offered the opportunity to take the subject at a higher academic level.

**6. FULL SUBJECT BASED BANDING**

* As part of MOE’s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students, our Lower Secondary students are in mixed form classes offering subjects at more or less demanding levels, calibrated to balance between greater customization of learning while ensuring they benefit from a broad-based education focused on developing strong fundamentals and stretching students to their fullest potential. 
* There are six Common Curriculum subjects that students attend together in their mixed form classes, i.e. Art, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), Design and Technology (D&amp;T), Food and Consumer Education (FCE), Music, and Physical Education (PE).
* While the learning outcomes will be common for all students, teachers will differentiate their teaching to meet the learning needs of different learner profiles to ensure that they continue to be sufficiently supported and challenged in their learning. This will allow students to learn at a suitable pace while ensuring that a high level of quality and rigour in teaching is maintained.

	*"Students who opt for Core History must take up Combined Humanities (Social Studies and Elective Geography or Elective Literature); students who opt for Core Geography must take up Combined Humanities (Social Studies and Elective History or Elective Literature)"*
		
* All secondary school students can offer **English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science** at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students' PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject. This provision will continue under Full SBB.

* Students in schools that are implementing Full SBB will also be able to offer **Humanities subjects** (Geography, History, and Literature in English) at a more demanding level from Secondary Two. The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students' aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary One.

* Under Full SBB, the GCE N and O Level examinations will be replaced with the new Singapore-Cambridge Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) examinations. This will apply for the 2024 Secondary One cohort. From 2027, the national certification will reflect the subject level at which each subject is taken. 


**7.	PERSONAL LEARNING DEVICE (PLD)**

**7.1	Will my child get a Personal Learning Device next year?**

* As part of the National Digital Literacy Programme, every secondary student would have their own Personal Learning Device (PLD) at Secondary 1. Parents will need to opt in to the programme so that the school can make a bulk purchase. Students can pay for the device through their Edusave accounts. For students from lower-income households, further subsidies are provided.
* The PLD that is used by Chua Chu Kang Secondary students currently is the Chromebook. The new cohort of Secondary 1 students will continue to purchase the Chromebook too. Complemented by enhanced internet connectivity in schools, PLDs will better support teaching and learning and develop students' digital literacies.

* There will be a trial period for CCAs and appeals to change CCAs can be made. Approval to change CCA will be given on a case-by-case basis.
