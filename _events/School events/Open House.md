CHUA CHU KANG SECONDARY SCHOOL OPEN HOUSE 2023
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQs)


**1.CUT-OFF POINTS**

**1.1	What is the school’s indicative PSLE Score range?**

Based on students posted to Sec 1 in 2023:
	

|   | G3 | G2 | G1|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ------|
| Achievement Level (AL)<br>(Source: MOE SchoolFinder) | 15 - 21     | 21 - 25     | 26 - 28 |

	
**Remarks:**
Meeting the indicative cut-off point (COP) does not guarantee admission to the school. The current year’s PSLE Score ranges may vary, depending on the demand pattern and cohort size.

**2. SCHOOL HOURS**

**2.1 What are the school’s start and end times?**
	
* Morning flag-raising will begin at 0800. Students are encouraged to be punctual for school and report earlier before 0750 to do quiet reading or self-study to prepare for the school day. Lessons will generally end between 2.30pm to 3.30pm.
	
 
**3. NUMBER OF SEC 1 CLASSES FOR 2024**

**3.1	How many classes are there for Secondary 1 in 2024?**
	
* In 2023, we had 6 Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB) classes. They were mixed classes of students taking subjects at G3, G2 and G1 levels. We are planning for a similar number in 2024 but there could be slight variations annually based on intake.

**4.	HIGHER MOTHER TONGUE LANGUAGES (HMTL) – FOR STUDENTS TAKING G3 MTL ONLY**

**4.1	Does CCKSS offer Higher MT languages for CL, ML &amp; TL?**

* CCKSS offers HMTL to students in the G3 course of study who are competent in their Mother Tongue Language. The objective of the HMTL course is to develop students’ fluency in all their chosen Mother Tongue Languages.
* HCL, HML &amp; HTL classes are offered within the school. Students do not need to travel to other centres to take HMTL.
* Prospective students must demonstrate their competence in the language before they can be offered HMTL. 

**4.2	Other Important Information:**

* HMTL lessons are conducted in school. Students will attend 4 hours of HMTL lessons per week – 3 hours during normal curriculum time and 1 hour after school.
* HMTL students will sit for the GCE O-Level MTL Exam at the end of Secondary 3, and the GCE O-Level HMTL Exam at the end of Secondary 4.
* As HMTL is a more demanding subject, compared to G3 MTL, students offering HMTL must put in consistent effort to do well. They are not allowed to drop the subject and switch to G3 MTL at any point in time.
* If a student uses HMT as his/her L1, he/she is not allowed to use MT in the computation of R5/R4, as MOE only allows students to use ONE MT grade at any one time, and not both. If he/she uses EL as his L1, he/she can choose either the HMT or MT grade for the computation of R5/R4, whichever is better.
* Hindi classes will be held within the school premises for the year 2024. However, this arrangement is reviewed on a yearly basis.  

**5.	SUBJECT ALLOCATION**
