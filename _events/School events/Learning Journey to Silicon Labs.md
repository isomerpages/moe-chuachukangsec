Our Sec 3 students embarked on a thrilling journey at the Silicon Laboratories on July 14th! Excitement surged as we discovered the intricate world of engineers and witnessed their creations from scratch. We learned how new products undergo rigorous design, testing, and validation, taking over a year to materialize across various nations. It was eye-opening to grasp the extensive collaboration required before products reach our hands. This enlightening experience expanded our horizons and left an indelible impression.
