# **New Media Literacies**

New Media Literacies (NML) are defined as the abilities to Curate, Create and Connect with others in the digital networked environment.  

Through NML lessons, our students develop an understanding of the social practices governing the digital networked environment that are undergirded by the six values:

These lessons (4 hours for Secondary 1-4 and 2 hours for Secondary 5) also prepare our students to manage, create and share digital information thoughtfully, ethically and responsibly. Engaging talks are organized for our students to understand their responsibility and be prepared for the knowledge based economy. They are encouraged to share their NML knowledge as positive influencers when opportunities arise.
