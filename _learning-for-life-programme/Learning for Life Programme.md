### Learning for Life Programme (LLP): 


#### Community & Youth Leadership (CYL)

In Chua Chu Kang Secondary School, the Student Leadership Development Programme forms a vital part within the Character Development Framework, addressing the Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) of students through the variety of Student Leadership opportunities and Student Welfare activities.  
  
Guiding the approach to Student Leadership Development are the following beliefs that underpin the Student Leadership Development Programme:  
• Leadership is concerned with effecting change on behalf of others and society.  
• Leadership is a process rather than a position.  
• Leadership is value based.  
• All students can lead.  
• Student voice raises standards in the school  
• One does not need to be promoted / given a title to lead  
• Leadership development is collaborative.  
• Requirement of a common language among students and staff   
• Working in partnership with agencies is essential for raising standards
