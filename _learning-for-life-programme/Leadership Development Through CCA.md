# **Leadership Development Through CCA**

Student leaders are the most critical element in creating the vibrancy within our Co-Curricular Activities (CCA). These student leaders (CCA leaders) are able to lead their juniors, organize CCA activities on their own and motivate their team members to help the CCA achieve greater heights. In the process, they hone their skills, confidence and competency to become better leaders.    

#### Facilitating Leadership Development in CCAs

Each CCA has an organizational structure with clear roles and responsibilities for its CCA leaders. Teachers in charge of the CCAs would also build in the necessary training and mentoring processes to ensure that the students appointed into leadership roles are well-equipped to do the job. A clear reporting structure of each CCA student leadership committee is set with specific teachers-in-charge who serve as advisors. The teachers also conduct a review session with the student leaders after the completion of major student-led activities.
