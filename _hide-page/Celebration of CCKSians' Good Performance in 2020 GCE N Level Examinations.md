Shirlene had a journey of enriching experiences and a string of achievements in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School.  She was a good time manager and persevered to work towards her personal goals. In recognition of her academic excellence, Shirlene attained the Edusave Merit Bursary in 2017 and the Edusave Scholarship in 2019. In 2019, Shirlene was top in standard for the Secondary 3 Normal (Technical) Course. 

Shirlene was strong in her Chinese Language. She was an eloquent speaker who communicated confidently with her teachers and schoolmates. She was able to take different perspectives during class discussions and took time to deliberate over issues and weighed her words carefully before she spoke. In 2019, Shirlene was Top in Basic Chinese for the Secondary 3 Normal Technical Course.

Shirlene loved the arts and exhibited, in particular, a keen interest in singing. She was a dedicated member of the school Choir. She was selected to represent the school in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. The Choir attained a Certificate of Accomplishment in 2019. Shirlene also represented the school in a public performance at the Keat Hong Community Centre under the PassionArts programme in 2019. 

Shirlene also cared for others, in particular, the less privileged. In 2017, as part of the Choir, she performed at the Bethany Methodist Nursing Home and Ren Ci Hospital to cheer the residents up.  In 2019, Shirlene visited and organised activities for the elderly at the SASCO Senior Citizens' Home with her classmates. She also took part in Values-in-Action (ViA) activities such as painting plank art for the CCK community and collecting old newspapers and clothes for fund-raising.

In CCKSS, Shirlene had opportunities to hone her leadership qualities. She served as the Stage Manager of the Choir from 2017 to 2020. As a Student Leader, she displayed a strong ability to relate well with others. She also demonstrated vitality and enthusiasm as she went about her duties and responsibilities, such as in organising the logistics during choir practices. As a leader, she was well-liked and respected amongst her peers. 

Congratulation and well done, Shirlene!

**Lydia Sng Bin Xin**&nbsp;  
**Clas 4-2**

<img src="/images/Lydia_Sng.jpg" style="width:25%">
		 
Lydia had a whale of a time as a student in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School. In 2019, she participated in the Youth for Causes (YFC) Project. Her team had selected Ren Ci Hospital as their beneficiary and aimed to raise awareness for their cause. She and her team organised street sales in various places around Singapore. The team spent much time deciding the products to sell to raise funds, creating promotional materials to attract patrons and raise awareness, as well as rallying for student volunteers to help out. In recognition of her services to the community, Lydia was the recipient of the Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES) under the Service category in 2019. 
  
Lydia was also the Vice-Chairperson of the school’s largest Co-Curricular Activity: Chinese Orchestra in 2019. As one of the Student Leaders, she was dependable and displayed a strong ability to relate well with others. She was able to give clear instructions during CCA sessions and was often seen encouraging her peers during their rehearsals. This is so important for an activity where practice truly makes perfect. “When you fail to plan, you plan to fail.” Lydia had this mantra in mind when she was one of the main planners for her CCA camp in 2019. She oversaw the camp and ensured that the activities were run smoothly and safely. Her efforts allowed her CCA members to bond and enjoy their experiences in the camp.

In addition, Lydia volunteered as a student ambassador to host exchange students from Japan. Along with her team, she designed activities to foster interactions between these students and the students from her school. Her efforts made these students feel much welcomed. Lydia also had the opportunity to visit Xi'an, China, as part of the school's Trips for International Experience (TIE) programme. She planned and participated in a scintillating performance that highlighted Singapore's culture for the students in Xi'an.

Lydia demonstrated self-motivation and resourcefulness. She was resilient and sought to better herself. She was the recipient of the National Youth Achievement Award (Silver) in 2020. 

Congratulation and well done, Lydia!

**Kenneth Wong Bin Hui**   
**Class 4-2**

<img src="/images/Kenneth_Wong.jpg" style="width:25%">

Kenneth was a demoralised student when he joined in Secondary 1, as he did not perform up to his expectations in the Primary School Leaving Examination. However, he was offered Chinese, English and Mathematics at the N(A) level and discovered a newfound interest in these subjects, which motivated him and boosted his morale. As he became more driven and responsible, Kenneth emerged as one of the top students in the N(T) stream in Secondary 1, and was offered a lateral transfer to the N(A) stream in Secondary 2. 

While Kenneth initially struggled with self-confidence after moving to the N(A) stream, he was determined to excel with support from friends found in his new class. Although some of the new subjects, like the Humanities, were challenging to him, he worked hard to cope with the additional rigour, constantly reaching out to his teachers to clarify his doubts. As a result, he topped the level in Elementary Mathematics, Science, Combined Humanities, and Food and Nutrition in Secondary Three in 2019, and was a recipient of the Edusave Scholarship Award. 

Besides his academic excellence, Kenneth was a student of outstanding character. He was a member of the prefectorial board, where he served the school in numerous school events. As a Peer Support Leader, he helped to ease the transition of his juniors to secondary school during the 2019 Secondary One Orientation Camp. In addition, he and a group of classmates organised a food donation drive in partnership with Fei Yue Community Services to help the elderly affected by the COVID-19 situation. For his contributions, resilience and compassion for the community, Kenneth received the Edusave Character Award in 2020. 

Congratulation and well done, Kenneth!
