Karis was someone who knew her direction in life. She was highly motivated and consistently worked towards her goals.  She was prepared for lessons, contributed actively to class discussions, asked questions when in doubt, and was on task – attributes of a self-directed learner. With good study habits and strong work ethics, it was thus no surprise that Karis did well in the national examination.

Karis understood the importance of holistic development and immersed herself in school experiences. She participated actively in sports-related activities such as our annual Sports Day and Cross-Country. Karis also loved the arts. She was a dancer representing the school in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, learnt Hip-hop, and took part in the 'CCKSS Have Talent' Competition in 2020, performing the song '1999' with a friend, for which they won first place.

Karis exhibited strong leadership qualities. She served as Captain of the Modern Dance Club. She was also Head Prefect. As Head Prefect, she led the Prefectorial Board not only in their discharge of their day-to-day duties, but also rendered strong support to student leadership development programmes such as the Student Leaders’ Forum, as well as various school-wide events, such as our annual Secondary 1 Orientation, Speech Day and Teacher's Day Celebration. Open House and Speech Day. 

On top of all these, Karis found time to play an active role in the community. In 2019, she organised a student-initiated performance for the Merdeka Generation at Bukit Batok East, and in 2020, she volunteered for the Citi-YMCA Youth For Causes Project, where she led her team to raise funds and create awareness for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Foundation. During this period of time, Karis also volunteered at the Bukit Batok East Constituency. She assisted Member of Parliament, Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, write letters for residents who may be facing difficulties, to the relevant authorities, during the weekly Meet-the-People Session. In recognition of her service and contributions to the community, Karis was presented the Outstanding Contribution in Community Services Award by the School Advisory Committee in 2021.

Karis’ school experiences had been fruitfully busy, enriching and vibrant, to say the least. “This was how I wanted my school life to be, colourful and multi-faceted, a time I can look back on and say I’ve grown well in those years”, said Karis, who would soon be starting a new chapter in St. Joseph’s Institution pursuing the IB Programme. 

Karis exhibited qualities we want CCKsians to embody. She served, grew and excelled. We wish her success in all her future undertakings.

**WILSON ANG ZI JUN**&nbsp;(Classs&nbsp;4-8)

<img src="/images/WILSON%20ANG%20ZI%20JUN.png" style="width:25%">

Wilson held himself to high standards and was never one who was complacent. He was in constant pursuit of excellence, always adopting a learner stance – seeking feedback and improvement – and steadily worked towards his personal goals.

Analytical, and with strong ability to think &amp; reason well, Wilson topped his cohort for Science in 2018, was Top in both Mathematics and Science in 2019 and Top in Chemistry, Humanities (Social Studies &amp; History) and Physics in 2020. Wilson was also a recipient of the Edusave Scholarship from 2018 to 2020. Despite these accolades, Wilson stayed humble with his feet firmly planted on the ground, and never let up on his efforts. 

School was not just all work for Wilson. He enjoyed making music and was an active and a dedicated member of the Chinese Orchestra. Recognised for his leadership qualities, Wilson was appointed Prefect and never failed to render assistance in school events and activities. He gained the respect of the people around him and was the recipient of the Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES) under the Leadership category.

Wilson’s desire to excel in all that he undertook spoke volume of his strong work ethics, and he was not one who was afraid of hard work. We are proud of Wilson and we believe Wilson would be an asset to any organisation he joins in the future. We wish him all the best!

### EXCEL – Story of Personal Excellence&nbsp;

**ANG WEI LIANG**&nbsp;(Classs&nbsp;4-6)

Always humble, always striving to improve – that was Wei Liang as we knew him. He was driven, set challenging goals for himself and always gave it his all to achieve them. He went about his work quietly, but was never one to compromise quality. Wei Liang was a champion who inspired his peers and classmates with his strong work ethics and pursuit of excellence.

In class, he made it a point to clarify his doubts and would pose questions that reflected his engagement. His work spoke of both effort to apply his learning and quality. His many academic accolades over the years are testimony to Wei Liang’s commitment to excel and his stamina. Wei Liang was a recipient of the Edusave Scholarship from 2018 to 2019. He was also Second in Standard in Secondary Two and First in Standard in Secondary Three. Wei Liang was one person who kept going. 

Wei Liang believed in giving his best to all that he undertook. A dedicated member of the St. John Brigade (SJB), Wei Liang’s commitment and enthusiasm were evident throughout his four years in SJB. He was instrumental to the Brigade attaining a 'Gold' in the SJB Corps Achievement Award in 2018 and 2019 and was selected to represent the school in many SJB competitions. He was a patient senior to the younger cadets and worked well with his peers. His dedication to the SJB won him the Chief Commissioner Badge, the highest award given to SJB cadets in secondary schools. 

Wei Liang served in the Prefectorial Board.  He discharged his roles and responsibilities dutifully and could always be counted upon to serve the school in all school activities. He also found time to volunteer at the Bukit Panjang Library. Wei Liang carried himself well, was always respectful and displayed honesty and integrity in the way he interacted with others. He was a befitting recipient of the Edusave Character Award. 

Wei Liang’s humility, his growth mindset and his habit of excellence are attributes we wish all CCKsians to emulate. We wish Wei Liang every success in the future!

### Grow – Story of Personal Excellence&nbsp;

**RAY HOA WAI JUN**&nbsp;(Classs&nbsp;5-1)

<img src="/images/Ray%20Hoa%20Wai%20Jun.png" style="width:25%">

Ray was teachable. He was a student who showed a lot of growth in his years at Chua Chu Kang Secondary School. Down the final stretch to the national examination, Ray was determined to do better than he did for the Preliminary Examination. One’s current performance is not indicative of what one can achieve in the future. The time and effort he invested paid off and Ray achieved a commendable improvement of 8 grades, for the O-Level Examination. Ray deserved a huge pat on the back. 

Ray took advantage of the opportunities presented to him in CCKSS to push himself beyond his comfort zone. He served in various roles in the Class Committee, from Class Monitor to Welfare Leader and Sports Leader, showing his readiness to seize opportunities that came by his way, as opportunities for growth, and to develop his potential. 

One who was passionate about Sports, you could always spot Ray at the school field or basketball courts, playing hard, sweating it out, and enjoying friendly games and competitions with his friends. He would participate zealously in sporting events. Ray was a strong runner. Consistently for three years, until the Cross-Country race was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ray was among the Top 10 runners in our annual Cross-Country Race. 

Secondary education is meant to be holistic, nurturing students in body, heart and mind, and Ray was a good example of a student who not only excelled academically but also took the initiative to develop himself holistically. We commend him for embodying a growth mindset and we wish Ray well in his future endeavours!
