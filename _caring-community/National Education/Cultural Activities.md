# **Cultural Activities**

Every year, all schools in Singapore commemorate Racial Harmony Day in order to celebrate Singapore’s diversity and also educate students on the importance of living harmoniously in a multi-racial society. 

In order to provide the students with an enriching and meaningful experience, the school centred the 2019 Racial Harmony Day celebrations around the role-playing of weddings of different cultures. Teachers simulated the process of Chinese, Malay and Indian weddings, creating an immersive experience for students. Ex-Education Minister Ong Ye Kung also graced the occasion and was even served tea by the Chinese “bride” and “groom”. 

After the celebrations, students will return to their classrooms and engage in group discussions on contemporary issues regarding racial harmony in Singapore. By the end of the day, students would have learnt of the importance of maintaining racial harmony in Singapore.
