# **Parent Support Group**

VISION : PARENTS FOR PARENTS FOR STUDENTS

1.    We believe that every parent is a supportive partner. Hence we aspire to forge a sustainable partnership with parents to provide strong support for the holistic development of our students and to nurture them to be lifelong learners and confident leaders. 

  
2.    The CCKSS’ Parent Support Group (PSG) was set up to build a strategic link between parents and the school.   
  
3.    The objectives of PSG are as follows:  

* To provide a support network amongst parents to learn and share best practices in supporting their children’s learning; 
* To assist and support the school in its programmes/activities and foster a close relationship with the school; and
* To enrich parents by organising programmes/talks/activities 

  
4.    All parents of our students are members of the PSG. A strong partnership between the school and parents is critical to our students’ holistic development. The PSG has been actively involved in our school events namely NE commemorative days, cultural festivities and even teacher’s day celebration. They had provided invaluable support to both our staff and students.

5.     In 2020, the PSG Executive members created the PSG logo to symbolize an anchored partnership between the school and parents with a nurturing heart. The partnership is symbolized by the hand which cradles in supporting every CCKsians’ growth as they strive for excellence. PSG aims to nurture the students heart that inculcates compassion and fosters passion in learning together, in a holistic environment and as a supportive community.
