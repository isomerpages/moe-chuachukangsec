##### _"ONCE A CCKSIAN, ALWAYS A CCKSIAN"_


### Vision

A Lifelong Relationship of Mutual Support and Growth


### Objectives

1.  To provide opportunities for CCKSS alumni to reconnect with students and staff, both former and current.
2.  To encourage alumni to give back to the school by passing on experience, knowledge and leadership skills to CCKSians. 

As CCKSians graduate from the school, they will automatically become members of the CCKSS Alumni. Alumni can participate in key school celebrations and events as guests or participants. They can also volunteer as adult leaders in CCAs, speakers for assemblies, advisors for the prefectorial board, and even organizers for school functions.
