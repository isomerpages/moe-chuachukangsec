The School-Home Link is a bi-monthly issue which aims to provide a structured means of communication with parents. The intent is to provide timely and important information so that parents are aware of key school events and programmes, and can thus provide the necessary support for their child. 

We encourage parents to read our School-Home Link so that they can be kept updated on the various school events and activities. We also welcome feedback for improvement.
