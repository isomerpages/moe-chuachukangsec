##### Introduction
The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004. It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school.
When choosing a secondary school, parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.
We would like to invite students with an interest or aptitude in the talent areas stated below and seeking admission to our school, to apply through this exercise.

The selection criteria and process for the talent areas will be updated from early-May.
