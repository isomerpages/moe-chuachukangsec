<h5><strong>Introduction</strong></h5>
<p>The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004.
It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity
to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking
admission to a secondary school.</p>
<p>When choosing a secondary school, parents and students are encouraged
to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths,
bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and
the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</p>
<p>We would like to invite students with an interest or aptitude in the talent
areas stated below and seeking admission to our school, to apply through
this exercise.</p>
