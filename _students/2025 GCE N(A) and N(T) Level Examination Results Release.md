their results are to report to the School Hall by 1.30 p.m. Students are
to be in their school uniform and observe proper decorum. Students who
turn up in improper attire and/or with coloured hair will not be allowed
to collect their results with the rest of the students. They will instead
be required to collect their results at another venue after the main group
has collected their results.</p>

to come to school only after 3.00 p.m. and proceed to the school’s General

documents (Authorisation Letter and Photo ID for identification) for the
school’s verification when collecting the results.</p>
