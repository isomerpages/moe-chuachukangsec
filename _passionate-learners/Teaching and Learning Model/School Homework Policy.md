# **School Homework Policy**

**Introduction**

Homework is a continuation of the learning process that is started in school.  It plays an important role in reinforcing learning, affirming students of their learning and providing the scaffolding for further learning.  It helps teachers in assessing the students’ progress and in identifying areas where more work is needed.  Research has shown that there is a positive correlation between the amount of homework done, but not when excessive, and student achievement.   

**Definition of Homework**

Homework refers to any learning activity that students are required by the school to complete outside curriculum time. This may include writing and reading assignments, researching for information and preparation for oral presentation.

**Objectives of Homework**

1.  Homework, when used appropriately, can improve students' academic ability, study skills and disposition towards learning.
2.  The objectives of homework are to help students:

(a) consolidate and reinforce skills, knowledge and understanding;   
(b) acquire and prepare for new learning; and   
(c) take responsibility for their own learning and develop good study habits.

3.  Judicious use of homework allows teachers to:

(a) help students consolidate learning that has taken place in the classroom or prepare for new learning;  
(b) check for students' understanding and progress, so as to provide timely feedback, intervention and support; and  
(c) review effectiveness of lessons taught.

4.  Homework also provides parents with:

(a) timely information on the learning progress of their child; and  
(b) opportunity to be involved in their child's learning.

**Rationale of School Homework Policy**

5.  The school homework policy is articulated for the following reasons:

(a) to emphasize the importance of homework as an integral part of students' learning experience; and   
(b) to lend clarity to teachers, students and parents of the school's guidelines for school homework.

**General Considerations for Setting Homework**

6.  There are 3 key considerations for setting homework, namely:

(a) Quantity of homework  
(b) Quality of homework  
(c) Feedback for homework

**Quantity of Homework**

7.  In giving homework, the school will take into consideration the following:

*   Age appropriateness of homework given;
*   Amount of homework given by different subjects;
*   Students’ involvement in other school programmes as well as their need for a balanced life, with adequate time for family bonding, social activities and personal interest(s).

8.  The number of pieces of homework per week, approximately 1 hr each:

*   English, Math, Science : 2
*   Other subjects: 1
*   _Maximum per day: 3_

**Quality of Homework**

9.  Homework is designed to bring about specific intended outcomes. It is generally related to class teaching, involve active and thoughtful work on the part of the students, and within their capabilities and developmental readiness.

**Feedback for Homework**

10.  Homework will be checked and timely feedback, interventions and support given to students. 

**Roles and Responsibilities of Stakeholders**

11.  Educators, parents and learners all play an important role in ensuring that homework serves its intended objectives.

**School’s responsibilities**

12.  The subject teacher is responsible for:

(a) Setting appropriate and meaningful homework;

(b) Setting realistic deadlines for submission of homework. At least 2 days to be given for completion of homework and submission to subject teachers;

(c) Communicating clear expectations to students on the purpose and procedures of homework;

(d) Co-ordinating with other teachers of the class on a frequency and quantity of homework to be given;

(e) Checking homework and provide timely feedback to students;

(f) Providing timely intervention and support to students; and

(g) Engaging parents on homework matters and provide them with information pertaining to students' learning progress.

**Students’ responsibilities**

13.  Students should:

(a) Understand the purpose of homework and what is expected of them;

(b) Keep track of homework instructions and deadlines;

(c) Manage time well to ensure that homework is completed and submitted on time;

(d) Give his/her best effort in completing homework;

(e) Review feedback from teachers on homework submitted; and

(f) Find out the work he/she has missed if he/she is not present in school. Being absent when homework is given is not an excuse for not doing it.

14.  When homework has not been done, appropriate action will be taken by the teacher. This may include corrective measures and counselling. Other consequences include implications on assessment of student conduct and academic performance.

**Parents’ role in homework**

15.  Parents should: 

(a) Create a home environment conducive for studying;

(b) Supervise and provide support for child's learning and encourage them to meet homework deadlines;

(c) Reinforce good study habits and attitudes;

(d) Be mindful not to overload the child with out-of-school activities; and

(e) Work in partnership with teachers to support child's learning and development.
