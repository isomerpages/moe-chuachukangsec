Shanice Lim exemplified many of the values we wish every CCKsian to embody. As a learner, she was self-directed, receptive to feedback, and engaged in reflection and introspection to improve her studies. As a student leader, she was humble and showed in her actions what it meant to serve. 

Shanice cared for the less fortunate and did her part for the school and wider community. As a member of the school Green Club, she helped to raise awareness on the importance of sustainable practices to protect our environment. Shanice also participated in the Eco Skit Competition for the Green School Awards in 2018 and 2019 that aimed to promote environment friendly practices. 

Shanice participated enthusiastically in the school’s old newspaper and clothing collection exercise, and took the initiative to help organise her class efforts to do so. She was also involved in putting up a skit for one of the PCF Sparkletots to educate the young children there about keeping the environment litter-free. In addition, Shanice helped out at the Chua Chu Kang Community Club Bursary Ceremony, as a volunteer. Last year, her class, Secondary 4/6, undertook efforts, out of their own initiative, to show appreciation to healthcare workers who were battling the COVID-19 situation. Shanice took an active role in this effort, and together, the class made mask extenders and appreciation cards for our healthcare workers. Shanice served a total of 136 hours from 2017 to 2020 in service to the school and larger community. 

Shanice was a dedicated Prefect and served in the Executive Committee of the Prefectorial Board. She discharged her roles and responsibilities dutifully. She could always be depended upon to serve the school in school activities such as during the Prefects’ camps, Teachers’ Day Celebration, Open House, National Day Celebration, Student Leaders’ Forum, Student Dialogue Session and during Secondary 1 Registration.

Shanice carried herself with proper decorum and sought to role model the school values. In recognition of her exemplary character, her humility and her desire to serve and contribute, Shanice received the Edusave Character Award in 2019. We are proud of Shanice and we wish her well in her future undertakings.
