Karis was someone who knew her direction in life. She was highly motivated and consistently worked towards her goals.  She was prepared for lessons, contributed actively to class discussions, asked questions when in doubt, and was on task – attributes of a self-directed learner. With good study habits and strong work ethics, it was thus no surprise that Karis did well in the national examination.

Karis understood the importance of holistic development and immersed herself in school experiences. She participated actively in sports-related activities such as our annual Sports Day and Cross-Country. Karis also loved the arts. She was a dancer representing the school in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, learnt Hip-hop, and took part in the 'CCKSS Have Talent' Competition in 2020, performing the song '1999' with a friend, for which they won first place.

Karis exhibited strong leadership qualities. She served as Captain of the Modern Dance Club. She was also Head Prefect. As Head Prefect, she led the Prefectorial Board not only in their discharge of their day-to-day duties, but also rendered strong support to student leadership development programmes such as the Student Leaders’ Forum, as well as various school-wide events, such as our annual Secondary 1 Orientation, Speech Day and Teacher's Day Celebration. Open House and Speech Day. 

On top of all these, Karis found time to play an active role in the community. In 2019, she organised a student-initiated performance for the Merdeka Generation at Bukit Batok East, and in 2020, she volunteered for the Citi-YMCA Youth For Causes Project, where she led her team to raise funds and create awareness for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Foundation. During this period of time, Karis also volunteered at the Bukit Batok East Constituency. She assisted Member of Parliament, Mdm Rahayu Mahzam, write letters for residents who may be facing difficulties, to the relevant authorities, during the weekly Meet-the-People Session. In recognition of her service and contributions to the community, Karis was presented the Outstanding Contribution in Community Services Award by the School Advisory Committee in 2021.

Karis’ school experiences had been fruitfully busy, enriching and vibrant, to say the least. “This was how I wanted my school life to be, colourful and multi-faceted, a time I can look back on and say I’ve grown well in those years”, said Karis, who would soon be starting a new chapter in St. Joseph’s Institution pursuing the IB Programme. 

Karis exhibited qualities we want CCKsians to embody. She served, grew and excelled. We wish her success in all her future undertakings.
