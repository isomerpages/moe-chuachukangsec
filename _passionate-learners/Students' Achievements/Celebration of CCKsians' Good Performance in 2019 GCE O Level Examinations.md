Hui Yi is an all-rounder who excelled academically and holistically. She is analytical and displays an ability to think and reason well. In 2018, she was top in Secondary 3 Express for Core Geography and Science (Chemistry, Physics) and has also excelled in her 2019 GCE O Levels. What is commendable is that Hui Yi is always willing to help her peers who had faced difficulties in these subjects as chairperson of her class. 

As captain of the Netball team, Hui Yi demonstrated a strong drive to achieve her goals and took pride in representing the school in the NSG Netball Championships in 2018 and 2019, as well as the West Zone Inter-School Netball Championships in 2016 and 2017. She had personally role modelled the intensity required in training sessions as captain so that the team could raise the standards of their game play. The improved quality of the team’s performances in 2018 and 2019 borne fitting testimony of her efforts. 

Hui Yi demonstrates the expectations of ‘Serve’ in the school’s motto with great distinction in her efforts to contribute back to the community.  Aligned with the school's Values-In-Action programme, she, as member of the Netball team, had conducted netball lessons for the Animation Club members in 2017 and netball clinics at Shuqun Primary in 2016 and Fu Hua Primary School in 2018. In 2019, she had also volunteered at Willing Hearts as part of the school's effort to help the less fortunate. 

Hui Yi is an all-rounder who not only excels academically, but inspires others through her exemplary service as a CCKsian.
