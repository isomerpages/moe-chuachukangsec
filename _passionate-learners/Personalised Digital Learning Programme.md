# **Personalised Digital Learning Programme**

Our school is a Phase 1 school for PDLP that will implement the programme in 2021 with the following intended outcomes:

### Support the development of digital literacies 

*   Students will learn digital skills such as gathering and evaluating information online, interacting with the online community, and creating digital products.

### Support self-directed and collaborative learning 

*   Students can access digital resources on their own to acquire knowledge about a topic of their interest beyond the curriculum. They can also share and build on one another’s ideas, and refine their own understanding.

### Enhance Teaching & Learning 

*   The learning environment in PDLP allows teachers and students to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching. For example, instructions, activities and feedback for each student could be more tailored and relevant to students’ learning needs.
