### DEPARTMENT VISION

The Humanities department aims to help CCKSians achieve value-added results through authentic learning experiences; Gain Interest in Humanities subjects; Think Critically and Be Active Learners.  

  
### DEPARTMENT MISSION

To help CCKSians achieve the above goals, we:  

*   create a positive learning environment that develops greater interest and encourages fun and active learning such as experiential learning through outdoor activities/lessons/enrichment/learning journeys.
*   develop department programmes that cater to the different needs of pupils of varying ability in the spirit of ability driven education such as peer-tutoring/student-led trail/banding/remediation/enrichment by an external agency.
*   integrate Thinking Skills, NE and IT in learning via in-house Social Studies resource package.

The Humanities Department offers Geography, History, Social Studies. The Department believes in influencing passionate learners and critical thinkers who will see the relevancy of Humanities subjects to everyday life. Humanities subjects equip students with critical thinking and communication skills as well as global perspectives to become confident persons, active contributors, and concerned citizens.  

The department uses the inquiry approach to learning where students are trained to investigate national and global issues by adopting different perspectives and questioning the accuracy and relevance of what they hear, read and see in their daily lives. Inquiry-based learning will prepare our students for more complex and broader challenges of the future. Humanities education is a fertile ground for grooming critical thinkers who can comprehend our increasingly diverse world and address the range of significant issues we face in society.

Different pedagogical approaches are deployed in the teaching of Humanities. These include investigative and experiential learning in Lower Secondary Geography and History. The Department also believes in the value of Learning Journeys as they offer an element of authenticity to value-add to classroom learning. Every learning journey is part of an important learning process, linking what students learn in class to what they see, feel and experience outside the classroom.
