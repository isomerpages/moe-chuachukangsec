### Department Vision

Lifelong Inquisitive Learners of Science

### Department Focus

a. Inculcate in students a sense of inquiry and curiosity.   
b. Equip students with Science process skills.   
c. Achieve academic excellence in Science.

We believe in providing opportunities for our students to develop 21st Century Competencies such as collaboration, investigative and ICT skills, and to nurture students to become self-directed and self-motivated learners. We aim to provide and involve every student with an inspiring and varied experience in the learning of Science. Our objectives are to help our students develop a strong sense of curiosity in the subject, make sense of, appreciate and apply Science in their daily lives. We believe all students have the ability to excel in Science.  

Through inquiry-based lessons and a student-centred approach that encourage students to learn and work independently in teams or individually, students develop scientific process skills such as logical planning and the ability to handle scientific materials and apparatus with confidence. Students also develop critical and inventive thinking skills, and opportunities are given to students to participate in projects and/or competitions where they can improve or apply their knowledge and skills.
