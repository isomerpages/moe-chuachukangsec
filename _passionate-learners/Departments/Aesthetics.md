### Department Vision

To develop creative thinkers and inventive problem solvers through an innovative and challenging instructional programme.  

### Department Subjects

The Aesthetic department comprises Art, Design & Technology (D&T), Music, and Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) instructional units. The Art curriculum makes use of inquiry learning to strengthen students’ observational skills and understanding of the elements and principles of Art to create personal art works and as well as develop critical thinking and appreciation of Art. Similarly the NFS curriculum engages students in inquiry learning of food and nutrition through a cyclical process of engagement, exploration, explanation and application. Students learn to be health conscious and discerning consumers who are able to make informed decisions on food and finances. The D&T curriculum develops students in design thinking which includes research, analysis and critical thinking skills in finding solutions to authentic problems. The Music curriculum develops students’ understanding of musical rudiments and builds confidence and skills in group ensemble performances including playing of the keyboard.
