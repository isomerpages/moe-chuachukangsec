### Department Vision

An active and vibrant sports community in CCKSS with a strong desire to pursue a healthy lifestyle.  

### Department Mission

The Department of Physical Education aims to equip CCKSians with the knowledge, skills and desire to maintain lifelong physical fitness, mental and social health. This is carried out through creating an integrated learning environment which enhances the acquisition of psychomotor skills related to sports, active participation, an understanding of the various sports concepts and learning of cognitive and behavioural skills to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Through the PE programme, CCKSians will also be developed in character and leadership.  

#### PE program at CCKSS

In line with our school motto 'Serve, Grow and Excel', the PE programme provides opportunities for students to look beyond themselves and work together as a team, growing in knowledge and understanding of the various Physical Activities so as to excel in the areas they are passionate about.  

#### This is implemented through the twin strategies of:

*   A holistic approach that develops all students in the areas of Physical, Cognitive, Emotional/Mental and Social Health.  
    
*   A tiered approach; with a broad-based PE curriculum that caters to the whole school coupled with customised programmes that targets selected students for specific areas of development.

#### PE Curriculum Focus (Mass)

The department focuses on lifetime activities and seeks to maximize students’ opportunities for exposure to sports both within and outside Physical Education classes. Health knowledge, psychomotor skill development, social / emotional competencies and thinking skills are also developed at all levels.

#### PE Programmes (Specialised)

In the graduating year, CCKSian have the opportunity to choose a sport that they would like to further learn and develop in. Students who are well-versed in the various sports take the lead in sharing their knowledge in their area of expertise. Teachers facilitate the learning and mentor student coaches at these sessions. 

#### Health & Fitness Programme

The objective of the Health and Fitness Programme is to focus on a select group of students who needs more attention to maintain a healthier Body Mass Index. They join the ReFRESH programme – a collaboration between the Health and Promotion Board and schools, which has regular weekday activities to inculcate active lifestyle amongst these students. PE teachers also work closely with them and advise on ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 

#### Sports Specialisation

The school collaborates with Sport Singapore through the Sports Education Programme to offer sports enrichment modules as post-exam activities to broaden students’ interest and participation in sports. Sports specialisation also aims to supplement the PE curriculum by providing more training time and in-depth coaching through various Sports CCAs that engage coaches with professional certification and expertise to further hone students’ sports skills.
