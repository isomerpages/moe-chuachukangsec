### Department Vision

An active and vibrant sports community in CCKSS with a strong desire to pursue a healthy lifestyle.  

### Department Mission

The Department of Physical Education aims to equip CCKSians with the knowledge, skills and desire to maintain lifelong physical fitness, mental and social health. This is carried out through creating an integrated learning environment which enhances the acquisition of psychomotor skills related to sports, active participation, an understanding of the various sports concepts and learning of cognitive and behavioural skills to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Through the PE programme, CCKSians will also be developed in character and leadership.  

#### PE program at CCKSS

In line with our school motto 'Serve, Grow and Excel', the PE programme provides opportunities for students to look beyond themselves and work together as a team, growing in knowledge and understanding of the various Physical Activities so as to excel in the areas they are passionate about.  

#### This is implemented through the twin strategies of:

*   A holistic approach that develops all students in the areas of Physical, Cognitive, Emotional/Mental and Social Health.  
    
*   A tiered approach; with a broad-based PE curriculum that caters to the whole school coupled with customised programmes that targets selected students for specific areas of development.
