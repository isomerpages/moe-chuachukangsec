# **Leadership Course**

### Student Leadership Framework

The Student Leadership Development Programme is aligned to the school’s vision, values and motto. Therefore, its purpose is to produce Compassionate Leaders and the required attitudes, skills and knowledge are developed progressively over the Student Leader’s 4 to 5 years in CCKSS. 

As such, the Student Leadership Development is delineated into three key strategies: 

*   Explicit Teaching
*   Experiential Learning
*   Effective Reflection

### Leadership Education

In their time with the school, each student will undergo eight leadership modules that are progressive in nature. As students participate in the modules, they acquire a greater understanding of themselves and their abilities as well as the skills and attributes of leaders. After each module, its key messages are reinforced during Pastoral Care periods where application of the learning can be further explored. 

### Leadership Training

In terms of Explicit Teaching, the school adopts a 2-tiered approach to Student Leadership Development.

#### For All Students 

There is training for the masses via The 360 Degree Leader at the different grade levels with specific foci. It involves teaching the students three principles to help Student Leaders bring value and influence to and from different levels of the school. This will largely be done through workshops and concretised through On-the-Job Training.  The knowledge can be both generic as well as specific, pertaining to the roles and functions of the leadership opportunity. 

These three principles – Leading Across, Leading Up, & Leading Down – were proposed by John C. Maxwell, author of the acclaimed book, The 360 Degree Leader. This adopted model for CCKSS’ Student Leadership Programme will replace the former model of Student Leadership Development in the school, Everyday Leadership, which will be phased out by 2018.

#### For Targeted Groups 

At the second tier, training is customized for specific Student Leader groups, which includes:

*   Class Committees’ Role-Specific training (school level) 
*   Student Leadership Forum (Class Committees) 
*   Student Leadership Camp (Prefects, NE Ambassadors, CW Ambassadors, CCA Leaders) 
*   Leadership Group specific training (Prefect Camp, NE Ambassador Training, CW Ambassador Training, OBS) 

This structured progression in explicit teaching of leadership theory allows for Student Leaders to be guided in their development, to take charge of their own learning and to be more self-directed when they set targets and plan how to apply what they have been taught in workshops and seminars.
