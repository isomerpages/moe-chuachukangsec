# **Prefect Camp**

Every June holiday, the Executive Committee (EXCO) of the Prefectorial Board organises the Prefect Camp to train Prefects of all levels in communication skills, conflict resolution, and project management skills. With the mentorship of the Prefect Master and Prefect Mistress, the EXCO designs and plans activities for the 3-day, 2-night camp for the Prefects to glean the necessary learning points.

With the help of the Senior Prefects, the Junior Prefects are observed and assessed for suitability to take up the full responsibilities of a Prefect in the upcoming Prefect Investiture. Prefects in Secondary 3 are also put through further training to prepare them for mentoring roles as Senior Prefects in their final year in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School.
