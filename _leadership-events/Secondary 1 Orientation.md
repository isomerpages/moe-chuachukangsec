# **Secondary 1 Orientation**

With planning, training of Peer Support Leaders, and the preparation of logistics starting in the year-end school holidays, all the Prefects stand ready in the new school year to welcome the newest additions of the Chua Chu Kang Secondary School family. The Secondary 1 Orientation is a week-long induction programme during which student leaders help new students adapt and familiarise themselves to the new learning environment.

Prefects run the day-long First Day of School programme for the Secondary 1 students, in partnership with the Form Teachers, and thereafter the afternoon programmes for the rest of the week. Activities and talks are planned for the Secondary 1 students to inculcate school affiliation and a sense of belonging to their Form Classes.

Student Leaders from the 23 Co-Curricular Activities in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School also chip in to help the new students understand and appreciate student life. The CCA showcases and experiences in the Secondary 1 Orientation programme aim to enthuse and engage the Secondary 1 students in embarking on the Community and Youth Leadership experiences.
