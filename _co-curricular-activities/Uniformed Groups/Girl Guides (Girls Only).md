The Girl Guides’ mission is to enable girls and young women to develop to their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world. Guides live by the motto ‘Be Prepared’, where the Guides are ready for any kind of duty when they are called upon. Each Guide is given the opportunity to develop holistically, and is equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge.

CCKSS Guides are given opportunities to serve, interact and bond with other guides through activities such as Thinking Day, West Division Day and West Division Campfire. This year, CCKSS Guides participated in a beach clean-up during Thinking Day, West Division competitions such as Reuse Agent and Table Football where our Guides came in second and third respectively as well as manned a registration booth for the West Division Campfire.  

CCKSS Guides also serve actively in school events such as Sports Day, Cross Country Run and Speech Day. Every year, the Girl Guides participate in the school’s annual National Day Parade. Some Guides also participated in Singapore’s 54th National Day Parade, as part of the National Girl Guides contingent.

To encourage volunteerism and leadership skills, Guides organise and plan their own patrol initiatives. Some examples of such initiatives include volunteering their time and interacting with the residents of various Voluntary Welfare Organisations as well as sharing their Guides skills such as outdoor cooking and gadget making with other CCA groups in school. 

Guides also organise their own annual camp. During the camp, Guides are given opportunities to display their leadership and planning skills as well as impart their outdoor and guiding skills to their juniors. 

Guides are also sent for HQ training and camps such as Patrol Leader’s Training Camp and Camp Training Course in order to train and develop them to their fullest potential.
  
The Guides have attained the Puan Noor Aishah Gold Award since 2013.
