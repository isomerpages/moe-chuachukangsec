The Saint John Brigade (SJB) is an all-rounded CCA which provides cadets with lifetime knowledge and first aid skills, and helps them to build their character through weekly training.&nbsp;  

Cadets attend first aid courses and gain practical experience in first aid and nursing by helping out in hospitals. They also put their training to good use by providing first aid in school events such as Sports Day, Cross Country Run, Speech Day and National Day Celebration.&nbsp;

Cadets also attend courses and camps to hone their leadership skills. In 2019, eight cadets achieved the Chief Commission Badge Award, the highest award a cadet can attain in the SJB.&nbsp;

This year, cadets also held key positions like being the Parade Commander in the Muster Parade for the school’s National Day Observance Ceremony.&nbsp;

In addition, cadets participated in activities to raise funds for charitable purposes. They were recognised for their efforts in raising funds for St. John Singapore Flag Day. Together with other schools, cadets helped the zone to attain the position of 2nd Runner-up this year.

Cadets also participated in the St. John Singapore, Zone 4, Inter-Corps First Aid and Home Nursing Competition.&nbsp; They won the 1st Runner-up for the Ambulance Adult category and came in 4th for the Ambulance Cadet category. They also won the 2nd Runner-up for the Nursing Cadet category.

In addition, cadets trained hard and participated in competitions. The SJB has attained the Gold award in the Best Unit Competition since 2003.&nbsp;
