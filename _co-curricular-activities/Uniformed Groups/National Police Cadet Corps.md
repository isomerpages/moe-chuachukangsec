It was a busy and fruitful year once again in 2019.

  

Our boys and girls in blue did the school proud to retain a Silver in the annual Unit Overall Proficiency Awards (UOPA) 2019, given out by the National Police Cadet Corps Headquarters (NPCC HQ). In order to qualify for this award, both Teacher Officers and cadets played their part by taking part in various activities, courses and competitions. 

  

The unit took part in shooting competitions, enrichment courses and camps, sent cadets to take part in NPCC HQ’s annual parade and the National Day Parade and took part in community involvement projects. The Teacher Officers also performed various duties at these activities.

  

In addition, two of our cadets, Nivetha Vijayakumar and Ang Shao Heng, both from Secondary 5/1, were promoted to the rank of Station Inspector. This is the highest rank attainable by students in secondary schools. 

  

Sua Chin Rong from Secondary 4/6 was named Best Unit Cadet (Boy) 2018 and Jovinna Chua from Secondary 4/4 won Best Unit Cadet (Girl) 2018. 

In this year’s National Day Parade (SG54), our cadet Corporal Tan Yu Chien from Secondary 3/6, was part of the NPCC contingent on 9 August 2019.

All these went in no small way to boosting the profile of the unit and should help us to maintain at least a Silver award next year. Stay tuned.
