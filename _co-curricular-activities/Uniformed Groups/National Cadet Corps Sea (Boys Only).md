The Singapore National Cadet Corps (NCC) is a world-class military cadet corps youth organisation that aims to nurture committed and responsible youngsters to become disciplined and rugged leaders who are loyal to their country. Their mission reinforces the NCC motto: To serve with pride and dedication. Our unit has the privilege of serving as 1 of 17 sea units out of 154 secondary school units. 

During the March and June holidays this year, six cadets were given the opportunity to climb Mount Ophir as one of the adventure training opportunities provided by HQ NCC to maintain the adventurous spirit of our cadets and their resilient mindset as part of our cadets’ character development. This activity also helps to develop leadership competencies via fitness and discipline as cadets learn to motivate one another during the trekking.

In July, our Unit Sergeant Major MSG (NCC) Poh Cheng Kiat and SSG (NCC) Zain Ong went for a 6-day, 5-night Midshipmen Sea Training Deployment (MSTD). The cadets boarded the RSS Resolution, a Landing Ship Tank of the Republic of Singapore Navy, for an exciting voyage to Jakarta, Indonesia. 

SSG (NCC) Zain Ong commented, “My MSTD experience is a memorable one as it is the first time I have been on a warship. Given the opportunity to learn how the Navy operate the ship and the different navy traditions they have onboard, I genuinely feel thankful for this first-hand experience.”

For the work done in 2018, we are proud to announce that we have been awarded Distinction for the Unit Recognition Award. With the contributions of the cadets, teachers and alumni, we have strived to keep up the standard of the unit while at the same time, give cadets as many opportunities as possible to develop values of responsibility, resilience and loyalty.
