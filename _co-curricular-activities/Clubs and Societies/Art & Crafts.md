The mission of the Art Club is to allow members to appreciate and create various forms of art. The Art Club aims to provide opportunities and platforms where members are actively involved in art-creation and art critiques through teamwork, self-management, sharing of skills and creative ideas. Members experience learning outside of the classroom, during learning journeys to museums and art exhibitions, as well as outdoor sketching.   

Throughout 2019, members had the opportunity to learn various forms of art, such as printmaking, tape art, abstract painting, ceramics and metal tooling. They were exposed to different art techniques and applied these techniques to create their own artworks.

The club also had a two-day one-night camp, where there were bonding opportunities and development of leadership skills for members. Activities for the camp included hiking, ball games and a movie night. Student Leaders planned and carried out the activities with the teachers’ close guidance.
