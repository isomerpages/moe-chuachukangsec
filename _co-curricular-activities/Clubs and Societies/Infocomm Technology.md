The Infocomm Club (AVA) was initially set up to assist in the school’s day-to-day AVA operations during morning assembly. It has expanded to render its support for various school events.&nbsp;  

The club comprises a team of dedicated members who are responsible for providing media support and seeks to constantly deliver high standards in terms of audio and visual aid so that the school has enjoyable experiences during school events like the Secondary One Orientation, CCA Open House, Chinese New Year Celebration, Sports Day, Speech Day, National Day Celebration, Graduation Ceremony and Deepavali Celebration. On top of official school events, members have graciously helped to meet the needs of other CCA groups within the school, such as recording a skit to be sent for a competition or providing and operating audio equipment for their rehearsals.&nbsp;

The club believes in giving every member an opportunity to develop his or her interests and serve the school community. Teachers allow students to be leaders in their various areas of expertise, be it at the forefront leading a team of photographers, troubleshooting when there are glitches or making sure the audio, visual and lighting systems operate smoothly during school events.&nbsp;

In 2019, members participated in the 8th National Young Shutterbugs 2019 – Young Film Makers Competition. This is the club’s second year of participation, having won first and second place in last year’s competition. A few members have also put their photography skills to good use by capturing stunning photographs in the school’s In My Backyard Biodiversity Competition. These competitions allow members to gain exposure, and to hone their photography and videography skills.
