The mission of the Robotics Club is encapsulated in the motto ‘Create. Command. Conquer’. We create an environment that is conducive for learning and bonding for all. We command our own lives and do not let laziness, complacency and bad habits creep in. We conquer the inner and outer obstacles in our lives and emerge victorious. Every club member is instilled with a positive attitude towards learning.  

The highlight of the year was a two-day one-night camp where students spent time learning from and bonding with one another. They carried out their Values-in-Action (VIA) programme in teaching students from the Drama Club to build and operate a basic Lego robot. Activities for the camp were mainly planned and led by the club’s Student Leaders. They were supported by the remaining members of the club. This camaraderie creates a conducive and vibrant learning environment.

Our achievements for 2019 included attaining the Best Design Award and a Merit Award in the Creative Challenge category, and a Merit Award in the Obstacle Challenge category in the ITE Robotics Challenge. The club also attained third placing in the ‘Sumobot’ category in the National Robotics Competition.
