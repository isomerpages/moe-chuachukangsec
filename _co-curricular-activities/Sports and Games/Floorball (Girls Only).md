Floorball is a fun and fast-paced game that is very enjoyable. The Chua Chu Kang Secondary School Floorball team is made up of female students who possess sportsmanship and resilience, and strive to do their best. The team works hard to improve themselves every year for their annual competitions.&nbsp;

Senior members organise annual floorball camps where they plan activities to better hone their floorball skills as well as build team spirit. The team also collaborated with the Animation Club to facilitate an exchange of skills between the two CCAs. The Animation Club members learnt how to play floorball while floorball members learnt how to create storyboards.

During the competition season, the students had to juggle between their studies and extra training sessions. Despite that, they never complained. Instead, they worked harder because of their passion for floorball. A lot of sweat, effort and time are poured into training even after the team finished its zonal competitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
