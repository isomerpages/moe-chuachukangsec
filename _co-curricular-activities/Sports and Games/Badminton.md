Badminton at Chua Chu Kang Secondary School is all about passion and love for the sport. The majority of students have minimal experience when they joined. Their perseverance and resilience have paid off, as they gained mastery in the sport through intense training to compete in various inter-school competitions.&nbsp;

Every member is given opportunity and exposure to represent the school. This year, students participated in various competitions, such as the West Zone Inter-School Badminton competition, the Wee Kim Wee Badminton Challenge trophy, the Swiss Cottage Secondary Schoolâ€™s Invitational Badminton Team Challenge and friendly matches with other schools. In these competitions, members faced formidable opponents.&nbsp;

Besides physical training and competitions, recreational activities were organised to forge team spirit among the members. The annual Badminton Camp and Farewell Ceremony were two memorable events where students fostered strong bonds and camaraderie.&nbsp;

We also organised an Inter-Class Badminton Competition for all non-badminton team students. Through organizing this activity, members were given opportunities to hone their leadership skills.&nbsp;
