Wushu is derived from traditional Chinese martial art practices and blends elements of performance and martial arts. In competitive Wushu, athletes execute complex routines that can either be performed barehanded or with weapons. They are judged according to the quality of movements, coordination and strength.  

Speed, strength and stamina are required to perform the routines well. Through the practice of Wushu, students strive to improve their physical abilities and mental strength. The students also learn to be resilient and exercise self-discipline to persevere through the tough physical training.

CCKSS Wushu programme begins with Secondary 1 students learning the basic Wushu steps and the training difficulty progressively increases through the years. Students who attain a certain level of mastery will be selected to represent the school in performances and competitions. 

Training focuses not only on the building of physical attributes, but also on the holistic development of the child. Another strength is the rapport built among members, teachers and instructor. These bonds remain even after students graduate from the school. Our alumni return frequently to join weekly training sessions and to guide the new members.

Under the guidance of our instructor, coupled with the hard work put in by our athletes, commendable results were produced this year.
