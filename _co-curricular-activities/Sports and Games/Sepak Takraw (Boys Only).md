Over the past decade, Chua Chu Kang Secondary School has produced one of the finest Sepak Takraw teams in Singapore. The school receives students with no prior knowledge in Sepak Takraw and develops them to be proficient players. They undergo an integrated programme and develop their skills, sportsmanship and personal values. Throughout the year, students participate in various competitions. 

The three core values of the school, Serve, Grow and Excel, are imbued in students when they learn to serve one another, grow as a team as well as individuals, and excel in both sports and studies. 

The team’s motto is ‘Power is nothing without control’. Control comes from diligent training to master skills to control the ball, and not just the use of strength or raw talent.

This year, the ‘B’ Division team came in third in the Singapore Schools National Competition for Sepak Takraw. 

Our ‘B’ Division team also attained the Singapore Schools Colours Award.

Two of our players, Syed Mohd Khairulazizi and Muhammad Hilmi Bin Abdul Rahim represented Singapore in the ASEAN Youth Games.  

Syed Mohd Khairulazizi attained the Best Sports Boy for the national competition. He was also the flag bearer for the Singapore Team for the ASEAN Youth Games.
