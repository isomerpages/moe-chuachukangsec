The Movement and Dance Club specialises in Contemporary Dance and aims to nurture a pool of talented and passionate dancers in CCKS. Through the club’s comprehensive dance education programme, students not only pick up dance techniques and build up muscular strength, they also gain a strong appreciation for the arts, develop tenacity and resilience, and become confident in achieving personal and dance goals.&nbsp;  

  

After achieving the Certificate of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation in 2019, the club was thrilled to be invited for a National Performance at the Istana Openhouse event this year. The club was also invited to showcase their SYF performance during the school’s online celebration of Speech Day in 2020.

Despite the challenges contributed by Covid-19, the club continues their regular training and practices using safe and innovative methods such as utilising eCCA sessions where majority of the members can continue to train in the safety of their own home, minimising the number of members training in school physically.&nbsp;

With the members’ commitment to excellence and quality even in difficult situations, the club looks forward to greater achievements when the storm is over.&nbsp;
