The mission of the Chinese Orchestra is to inspire students to love music, be good team players and strive for musical excellence.  

  

This year, the Chinese Orchestra attained the Certificate of Accomplishment for their performance in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2019 Arts Presentation. It was a good platform for members to hone their skills and learn to play in harmony.

  

Members were also actively involved in various events and performances that aimed to strengthen their musical competencies and self-discipline. These events and performances allowed members to share their love for Chinese Orchestra music. For instance, students trained hard for performances including the schoolâ€™s Chinese New Year celebration and Speech Day 2019. In addition, students attended the annual camp that was organised to provide them with the opportunity to come together as one, to bond and to interact.

  

The Chinese Orchestra also aims to nurture students into compassionate individuals who have a heart for the community. As such, students participate in Values-in-Action programmes to serve the community. This year, our Secondary 3 students took on the challenge to embark on the student-initiated Citi-YMCA Youth for Causes projects. This taught them to step beyond their comfort zones in order to raise funds and awareness for their chosen welfare organisations.

With the dedication and commitment of students, instructors and teachers, we believe we will soar to greater heights.
