The Drama Club provides a platform for students to explore not only their talents and abilities in theatre, but also to grow their capacity for empathy. Students are nurtured to be compassionate leaders who are ready to step up and think on their feet in challenging situations.&nbsp;  

The highlight of the Drama Clubâ€™s journey in 2019 was preparing for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) production, The Accident, for which the club attained the Certificate of Accomplishment. Students learnt skills such as teamwork and grew in confidence and this helped them to develop into young adults who are more willing to step out of their comfort zones.
