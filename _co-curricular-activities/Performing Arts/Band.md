The band is one of the Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) CCAs in the school. The objective of a VPA CCA is to provide opportunities for students to develop a lifelong passion for the arts. Through activities and events, students will develop 21st Century Competencies, thinking skills, social emotional competencies and values.&nbsp;

Chua Chu Kang Secondary Concert Band aims to provide a platform for like-minded individuals to make music together and establish lifelong friendships. Students attend music theory lessons and learn a musical instrument from our dedicated music instructor, Mr Kenneth Lun, during band practices.&nbsp;

In the band, the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts as good teamwork, respect and harmony among members are essential for the making of beautiful music. The band also offers students many opportunities, through camps and leadership workshops, for students to develop their leadership skills and grow into confident leaders of the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The band plays an important role within the school, performing at major school functions such as Speech Day and National Day celebrations. It has also been proudly making music for the enjoyment of the rest of the school community.&nbsp;

The band represented the school in the 2019 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for Concert Bands and has done the school proud by obtaining a Certificate of Accomplishment for their hard work. The band also has the opportunity to attend concerts by local professional music groups such as the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. This allows students to learn how to appreciate, enjoy and respond to the performing arts.&nbsp;

The band also contributes actively to the community, organising and participating in Values-in-Action projects yearly. The band performed for PCF Sparkletots Preschool Childcare Centre when the teachers and pre-schoolers came to visit the school. The band also performed for Carpe Diem Childcare Centre when the band visited the centre. In addition, the band performed for a Passion Arts event organised by the Choa Chu Kang and Keat Hong Community Club. Such opportunities give students a platform to display their musical talents as well as allow students to connect with the community while sharing their love for music-making.
