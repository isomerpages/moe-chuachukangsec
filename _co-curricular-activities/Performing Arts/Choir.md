The Chua Chu Kang Secondary School Choir sings and performs songs of a variety of genres, formats and languages.  

In 2019, the Choir performed in the Voices for Singapore Festival at CHIJMES which was open to the public. We also achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment for the 2019 Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation.&nbsp;
