<h1><strong>Parent Support Group</strong></h1>
<h4><strong>Our Vision: Parents for Parents for Students</strong></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We believe that every parent is a supportive partner.
Hence we aspire to forge a sustainable partnership with parents to provide
strong support for the holistic development of our students and to nurture
them to be lifelong learners and confident leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The CCKSSâ€™ Parent Support Group (PSG) was set up
to build a strategic link between parents and the school.&nbsp;</p>
