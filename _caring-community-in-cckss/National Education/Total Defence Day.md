# **Total Defence Day**

Total Defence Day is marked annually on February 15 to commemorate the anniversary of the surrender of the Japanese in 1942. The theme for this year is Together We Keep Singapore Strong. It serves as a reminder to all Singaporeans that the responsibility of defending Singapore lies not just in the defence force but also in all Singaporeans.    
  
This annual event reminds us that the task of nation-building is not easy, and that we must work hard to preserve our present prosperity and stability. This year, students were familiarised with the 6 pillars of total defence namely military defence, civil defence, psychological defence, economic defence, social defence and digital defence. They participated in the pledge making stating how they can play a part and contribute in each pillar of defence. Various activities and programmes, including CCE lessons, poster exhibition and sharing by NE ambassadors have also highlighted the importance of being an active citizen of Singapore.  
  
It is the school’s hope that our students are aware of Total Defence being the cornerstone of Singapore’s deterrent strategy and it is crucial for the continued security, survival and success of the country. More importantly, each and every one of us has a part to play in the overall defence of our nation.
