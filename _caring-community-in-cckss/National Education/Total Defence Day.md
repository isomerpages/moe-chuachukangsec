<h2><strong>Total Defence Day</strong></h2>
<p>Total Defence Day is marked annually on February 15 to commemorate the
anniversary of the surrender of the Japanese in 1942. The theme for this
year is Together We Keep Singapore Strong. It serves as a reminder to all
Singaporeans that the responsibility of defending Singapore lies not just
in the defence force but also in all Singaporeans.</p>
<p>This annual event reminds us that the task of nation-building is not easy,
and that we must work hard to preserve our present prosperity and stability.</p>
<p>It is the school’s hope that our students are aware of Total Defence being
the cornerstone of Singapore’s deterrent strategy and it is crucial for
the continued security, survival and success of the country. More importantly,
each and every one of us has a part to play in the overall defence of our
nation. Our student leaders also took part in the annual World War Two
memorial ceremony at the War Memorial Park.</p>
<p>This year marks Singapore’s 40th year of Total Defence. As a small state,
Singapore relies on a total defence approach to rally Singaporeans for
a whole-of-society response to threats to our sovereignty, security and
success. In order to further help our students to better understand the
importance of Total Defence in overcoming real-world challenges, on the
15th of February, we embarked as a school on the Food Resilience Experience.
Our students went through CCE lessons on food disruption and were provided
with a RTE (Ready-to-eat) meal supplied by the Singapore Food Agency.</p>
