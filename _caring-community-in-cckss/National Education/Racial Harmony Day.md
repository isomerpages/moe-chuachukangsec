<h2><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong></h2>
<p>Every year, all schools in Singapore commemorate Racial Harmony Day in
order to celebrate Singaporeâ€™s diversity and also educate students on the
importance of living harmoniously in a multi-racial society.</p>
<p>Racial Harmony is a priority for CCKSS. The Racial Harmony Day celebration
is a culmination of a whole week of activities. Students are able to view
informative exhibition panels about different cultures and enjoyed themed
booth activities from students of the Active Citizenry Committee, showcasing
costumes, wedding traditions and even games and medicine from different
cultures.</p>
<p>Our CCKSians also engaged residents at Chua Chu Kang Community Centre
over the weekend where they played and exchanged knowledge about the traditional
games of the different races, showcasing the unity and strength of our
multicultural society.</p>
