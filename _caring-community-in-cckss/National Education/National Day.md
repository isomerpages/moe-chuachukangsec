# **National Day**

Every year, National Day is celebrated in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School with the cooperation of all the uniformed groups in a parade and march-past. The efforts of the practices and rehearsals of the uniformed groups will be displayed in the morning celebrations. 

  

After the parade, students usually engage in singalong sessions led by the prefects to sing the various songs that had been composed for past National Days. This culminates with a lesson in class where students discuss about the year’s National Day theme and national identity in Singapore.
