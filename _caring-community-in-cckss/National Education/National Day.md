<h2><strong>National Day</strong></h2>
<p>Every year, National Day is celebrated in Chua Chu Kang Secondary School
with the cooperation of all the uniformed groups in a parade and march-past.
The efforts of the practices and rehearsals of the uniformed groups will
be displayed in the morning celebrations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the parade, students usually engage in singalong sessions led by
the student councillors to sing the various songs that had been composed
for past National Days. This culminates with class or level celebrations
linked to the yearâ€™s National Day theme and national identity in Singapore.</p>
