<h2><strong>International Friendship Day</strong></h2>
<p>As a little red dot surrounded by a sea of green, Singapore realises the
importance of forging strong solidarity and friendship with its neighbouring
countries in order to survive. This ideal is imparted in students through
the International Friendship Day commemorated every year on the third Friday
of Term 2. This day is dedicated to the understanding of Singapore’s relations
with neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims to alert students towards
the geo-political realities inherent in Singapore, as well as nurture in
them the spirit of friendship and partnership among different countries
and different people.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;CCKSS, International Friendship Day provides&nbsp;students&nbsp;the
opportunity to explore Singapore’s connection to the region and the world.
This is particularly important as we recognise Singapore’s position as
an international hub in the region for many international stakeholders.
As such, students in this school are taught to understand the good relations
we have forged and continue to share with the world and never to take such
valuable relations for granted. Through various activities and programmes
in place involving students’ knowledge and understanding of various international
cultures,&nbsp;CCKSS&nbsp;strives to ensure that by celebrating the International
Friendship Day, we could achieve our goal of:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>allowing students to examine how communities in Southeast Asia are connected
through cultural, economic and geographical ties, thus learning the value
of maintaining good relations with our neighbours in the region;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>helping students gain a deeper appreciation of regional cooperation and
recognising how an active foreign policy has enabled us to maintain our
international space and good relations with neighbouring&nbsp;countries;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>infusing&nbsp;students with a global outlook that makes them open to working
well with people of different cultures, both within Singapore and in the
world at large;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>helping students understand how the successful integration of Singaporeans
and new immigrants will contribute towards Singapore’s continued success
as an economy, society and&nbsp;nation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>guiding, challenging and correcting students’ misconceptions and/or stereotypes
of new immigrants and providing a platform for them to express acceptance
of foreign cultures and norms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
