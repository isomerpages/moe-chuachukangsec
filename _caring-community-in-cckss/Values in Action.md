# **Values-in-Action**

### Values-in-Action

As we aspire to be a kinder, more gracious society, our young must be taught to care for others. Our Values-in-Action (ViA) programmes encourage our students to interact with people of different backgrounds and do their part to better the lives of those who are less privileged. Through this, we hope to nurture our students to be active citizens with a keen social conscience, to think beyond themselves and to learn to appreciate the people around them better.

  

In 2013, we had a whole â€“school newspaper collection exercise around the neighbourhood of Teck Whye and Choa Chu Kang to raise funds for the needy families in our community. In addition, our students also went to various homes for the elderly and to orphanages both in Singapore and Malaysia. These experiences definitely opened their eyes to the realities of what life is like for the less fortunate and in the process, they learnt that no effort is too small to help improve the lives of others.
